# Open Badges Specification

## Abstract

This specification is a new version of the [1EdTech Open Badges Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/digital-badges) that aligns with the conventions of the [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) for the use cases of [Defined Achievement Claim](#dfn-defined-achievement-claim) and a [Skill Claim](#dfn-skill-claim). The credentials that are produced are easily be bundled into [Comprehensive Learner Records](#dfn-clr) and [Verifiable Presentations](#dfn-vp). Portability and learner data privacy are improved by expanding the usage of cryptographic proofs/signatures, because this format will be compatible with a growing array of proof schemas that are developed for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model.

## 1. Introduction

[](#introduction)

### 1.1 Audiences

[](#audiences)

The target readers for this document are:

- Business Leaders - the people who are responsible for identifying the business case for using verifiable digital credentials and badges

- Solution Architects - the people who are responsible for the definition and design of systems, applications, and tools that are to be used to issue, exchange, and verify digital credentials and badges

- Product Developers - the people who are adding functionality to issue, exchange, and verify digital credentials

### 1.2 Document Set

[](#document-set)
The Open Badges Specification has several related documents and artifacts shown below. Together they make up the specification.

- [Open Badges Specification v3.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/) ([[OB-30](#bib-ob-30)]) - The main Open Badges Specification document.

- [Open Badges Implementation Guide v3.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/impl/) ([[OB-IMPL-30](#bib-ob-impl-30)]) - Provides information to lead you to successful implementation and certification of the Open Badges 3.0 specification.

- [Open Badges Specification Conformance and Certification Guide v3.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/cert/) ([[OB-CERT-30](#bib-ob-cert-30)]) - Specifies the conformance tests and certification requirements for this specification.

#### 1.2.1 OpenAPI 3.0 Files

[](#docs-openapi)

The Open API Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

- [YAML OpenAPI File](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/openapi/ob_v3p0_oas.yaml)

#### 1.2.2 JSON-LD Context File

[](#json-ld-context-file)

When two people communicate with one another, the conversation takes place in a shared environment, typically called "the context of the conversation". This shared context allows the individuals to use shortcut terms, like the first name of a mutual friend, to communicate more quickly but without losing accuracy. A context in JSON-LD works in the same way. It allows two applications to use shortcut terms to communicate with one another more efficiently, but without losing accuracy.

Simply speaking, a context is used to map terms to IRIs. Terms are case sensitive and any valid string that is not a reserved JSON-LD keyword can be used as a term.

#### 1.2.3 JSON Schema

[](#json-schema-0)

All JSON Schema can be found in [§ E.2 JSON Schema](#json-schema). JSON Schema files for credential and API schema verification are available online:

- [AchievementCredential JSON schema](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/json/ob_v3p0_achievementcredential_schema.json)

- [EndorsementCredential JSON schema](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/json/ob_v3p0_endorsementcredential_schema.json)

- [GetOpenBadgeCredentialsResponse JSON schema](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/json/ob_v3p0_getopenbadgecredentialsresponse_schema.json)

- [Profile JSON schema](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/json/ob_v3p0_profile_schema.json)

- [Imsx_StatusInfo JSON schema](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/json/ob_v3p0_imsx_statusinfo_schema.json)

Note
The above schemas are based on the [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/). An issuer may also issue credentials
following the previous version [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/). JSON schema matching that version are:

        [AchievementCredential JSON schema (Verifiable Credential Data Model v1.1 compatible)](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/json/ob_v3p0_anyachievementcredential_schema.json)
        - [EndorsementCredential JSON schema (Verifiable Credential Data Model v1.1 compatible)](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/json/ob_v3p0_anyendorsementcredential_schema.json)



    Verifiers may accept credentials following either schema using
    [Schemas for verification support](#org-1edtech-ob-v3p0-model-6).

### 1.3 Conformance Statements

[](#conformance)
As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

          The key words
          MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, NOT RECOMMENDED, NOT REQUIRED, OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT
          in this document $are to be interpreted as described in $[object Object].


An implementation of this specification that fails to implement a MUST/REQUIRED/SHALL requirement or fails to abide by a MUST NOT/SHALL NOT prohibition is considered nonconformant. SHOULD/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED statements constitute a best practice. Ignoring a best practice does not violate conformance but a decision to disregard such guidance should be carefully considered. MAY/OPTIONAL statements indicate that implementers are entirely free to choose whether or not to implement the option.

      The [Conformance and Certification Guide](#document-set) for this specification may introduce greater normative constraints than those defined here for specific service or implementation categories.

### 1.4 Terminology

[](#terminology)

Achievement Type: A vocabulary which describes the type of achievement.

Alignment: An alignment is a reference to an achievement definition, whether referenced in a resource outside the package or contained within the package.

Achievement: This is the content description of a credential that an assertion references. It contains metadata such as the name of the achievement, description, alignment of skills, etc. An [Assertion](#dfn-assertion) asserts a single achievement. A [CLR](#dfn-clr) asserts a collection of assertions, each of which asserts a single achievement.

Assertion: The core of both Open Badges and CLR is the assertion about achievement(s). Assertion properties are specific to one learner's achievement and specify metadata such as issuer, date of achievement, expiration data, as well as results and evidence that support the assertion. A [Verifiable Credential](#dfn-vc) more broadly asserts a claim about a Credential Subject which can be applied to education and occupational achievements.

Claim: A statement about the Credential Subject. A claim may include associated evidence, results, or other metadata regarding a specific achievement, skill or assertion.

client: In a [REST API](#dfn-restful-api), the client is the actor that initiates the DELETE, GET, or POST request. Also called a Consumer in the [IMS Global Security Framework v1.1](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p1/).

Comprehensive Learner Record (CLR): Set of assertions that can be packaged as a verifiable credential.

Credential: A set of one or more [claims](#dfn-claim) made by an [issuer](#dfn-issuer). A [verifiable credential](#dfn-vc) is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build [verifiable presentations](#dfn-vp), which can also be cryptographically verified.

Credential Subject: Describes the claims being made by the Verifiable Credential. In the context of Open Badges and CLR is typically an individual but in the case of Open Badges, may be another entity type such as a course, book, or organization. Learners, Organizations and other entities can be explicit subclasses of Credential Subjects for purposes of business rules. [[vc-data-model-2.0](#bib-vc-data-model-2.0)]

Decentralized Identifiers: A type of identifier for people, organizations and any other entity, where each identifier is controlled independently of centralized registries. [[did-core](#bib-did-core)] [[did-use-cases](#bib-did-use-cases)]

Defined Achievement Claim: An [assertion](#dfn-assertion) that the learner achieved a specific [achievement](#dfn-achievement).

DID URL: A DID plus any additional syntactic component that conforms to the definition in Section 3.2 DID URL Syntax of [[DID-CORE](#bib-did-core)]. This includes an optional DID path (with its leading / character), optional DID query (with its leading ? character), and optional DID fragment (with its leading # character).

Evidence: Information supporting a claim such as a URL to an artifact produced by the Learner.

Issuer: The organization or entity that has made an assertion about a Credential Subject. The issuer of a DC Assertion is the authoritative source for that specific assertion.

Learner: The person who is the subject of the CLR and assertions contained in a CLR.

Linked Data Proof: A type of embedded signature proof.

Badge: A single assertion of an achievement that is packaged as a verifiable credential.

Organization: An organized group of one or more people with a particular purpose. [[CEDS](#bib-ceds)]

Person: A human being, alive or deceased, as recognized by each jurisdiction’s legal definitions. [[CEDS](#bib-ceds)]

Presentation: Data derived from one or more [verifiable credentials](#dfn-vc), issued by one or more [issuers](#dfn-issuer), that is shared with a specific [verifier](#dfn-verifier). A [verifiable presentation](#dfn-vp) is a tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification.

Publisher: The organization or entity issuing the CLR (typically the educational institution or a 3rd-party agent). The publisher is either the issuer or has a trusted relationship with the issuer of all the assertions in the CLR.

Relying Third-Party: Also referred to as the "verifier" of a VC. This entity requests, verifies, and may consume data being presented.

REST API: A style of web API (Application Programming Interface) loosely based on HTTP methods (DELETE, GET, POST, and PUT) to access resources (e.g. CLRs) via a URL.

Result: Describes a possible achievement result. A result may contain the rubric level that was achieved.

Result Description: Describes a possible achievement result. A result description may contain a rubric.

Rich Skill Descriptor (RSD): A machine readable reference to a description of a skill located at a unique URL. [[RSD](#bib-rsd)]

Role: People have roles in organizations for specific periods of time. Roles are a time aware association between a person and an organization. [[CEDS](#bib-ceds)]

Rubric: Defines levels associated with the achievement definition (e.g. "approaches", "meets", and "exceeds").

server: In a [REST API](#dfn-restful-api), the server is the actor that responds to a DELETE, GET, or POST request. Also called a Platform in the [IMS Global Security Framework v1.1](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p1/).

Skill: Measurable or observable knowledge, skill, or ability necessary to successful performance of a person.

Skill Assertion: An [assertion](#dfn-assertion) that contains a "skill result."

Skill Claim: An [assertion](#dfn-assertion) that the learner has the specified [skill](#dfn-skill).

Subject: A person about which [claims](#dfn-claim) are made.

Validation: The process of assuring the verifiable credential or verifiable presentation meets the needs of the verifier and other dependent stakeholders. Validating verifiable credentials or verifiable presentations is outside the scope of this specification.

Verifiable Credential (VC): A tamper-evident credential whose issuer can be cryptographically verified. See [[vc-data-model-2.0](#bib-vc-data-model-2.0)].

Verifiable Presentation (VP): A tamper-evident presentation of one or more Verifiable Credentials of which cryptographic verification can be used to determine the trustworthiness of the authorship of the data. [[vc-data-model-2.0](#bib-vc-data-model-2.0)]

Verification: The evaluation of whether a [verifiable credential](#dfn-vc) or [verifiable presentation](#dfn-vp) is an authentic and timely statement of the issuer or presenter, respectively. This includes checking that: the credential (or presentation) conforms to the specification; the proof method is satisfied; and, if present, the status check succeeds.

Verifier: The entity that receives a [verifiable credential](#dfn-vc) or [verifiable presentation](#dfn-vp) and verifies the credential or presentation has not been tampered with.

### 1.5 Conceptual Model

[](#conceptual-model)

This conceptual model describes Open Badges concepts and the relationship between those concepts. The data model in appendix [§ B.1 Credential Data Models](#org-1edtech-ob-v3p0-model-0) below is the normative reference for the classes and properties that are used to implement the concepts.

The conceptual model is targeted for all [§ 1.1 Audiences](#audiences), while the data model is targeted for Solution Architects and Product Developers.

In the diagram below, the concepts are shown in gray boxes (e.g. Assertion). Please see [§ 1.4 Terminology](#terminology) for definitions of the concepts.

Starting with this version of the Open Badges Specification, an Assertion is also a Verifiable Credential (VC) as defined by the [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) specification. The diagram includes labels that show the relationships between VC terminology and Open Badges terminology (e.g. Issuer is identified by the VC "issuer").

[Figure 1](#fig-diagram-shows-the-major-conceptual-components-of-an-open-badge-verifiable-credential) Diagram shows the major conceptual components of an Open Badge Verifiable Credential

I, issuer assert a claim about this Credential Subject that may describe an achievement, experience, membership, etc.,

The assertion provides the identity of the issuer, issuance date, and instructions on how to cryptographically prove the issuer identity and that the assertion and claim contents have not been tampered with since issuance.

- The claim must contain a single Credential Subject which identifies the recipient of the Open Badge.

- The claim may also contain: evidence of the achievement, and other properties supporting the achievement description.

- The Achievement description is described using properties that may be shared with the CLR including, name, description, criteria, etc.

## 2. Overview

[](#overview)
This section is non-normative.

### 2.1 What is the problem this solves for?

[](#what-is-the-problem-this-solves-for)

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are a format that is used to publish a limitless variety of [claims](#dfn-claim) about a [subject](#dfn-subject) person or other entity, typically through a cryptographic proof. VCs can be collected and delivered as part of a [presentation](#dfn-presentation) whereby authorship of each VC from the same or multiple issuers can be trusted via cryptographic verification.

These layers of cryptographic proof can provide security and privacy enhancements to Open Badges that were not available in version 2.0. Adoption of Verifiable Credentials will increase market penetration and use of Open Badges by addressing market needs for trustworthy machine-ready data to power connected ecosystems in education and workforce. This will unlock the door for Open Badges credentials to be included in a growing number of multi-purpose digital credential wallets entering the market. Stepping further into signed VCs and another associated technology, [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), unlocks increased longevity and resilience of Open Badges that can describe achievements even more expressively than they do today.

### 2.2 What does adopting Verifiable Credentials entail?

[](#what-does-adopting-verifiable-credentials-entail)

This specification changes the structure of the Open Badges [Assertion](#achievementcredential) class, to adopt the conventions of the [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/). This means that badges issued under this specification will not be conformant to all of the existing 2.x data model requirements.

Previous versions of an Open Badges Assertion, illustrated in the graphic below, structures its objects like this:
An Assertion identifies a recipient with a "recipient" relationship to an IdentityObject that contains identifying properties. It identifies which badge it represents with a "badge" relationship to a BadgeClass. It identifies its verification information with a "verification" relationship to a VerificationObject. It identifies its issuer with an "issuer" relationship between the BadgeClass and the Issuer.

[Figure 2](#fig-open-badges-2-0-diagram) Open Badges 2.0 Diagram

The Verifiable Credentials structure in this specification depicted below offers the same information with a slightly different structure: A Verifiable Credential identifies its recipient with a "credentialSubject" relationship to a subject class that is identified by an identifier. It identifies its issuer with an "issuer" relationship directly to an Issuer. The Credential claims the subject has met the criteria of a specific Achievement (also known as the BadgeClass in previous versions) with an "achievement" relationship to that defined achievement. And it identifies its verification information with a proof.

[Figure 3](#fig-diagram-show-the-major-conceptual-components-of-an-open-badge-verifiable-credential) Diagram show the major conceptual components of an Open Badge Verifiable Credential

### 2.3 Benefits and Opportunities

[](#benefits-and-opportunities)

It can be risky to make breaking changes to a specification used as broadly as Open Badges, but there are a range of benefits to making this move now while the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem is young and growing fast. There are strong use cases for digital credentials for learning and skill achievements across the nexus of education and employment, as we have seen from the broad adoption of Open Badges and the proliferation of industry groups making connections between educational institutions and the employment market around digital credentials. Technical compatibility is in a more favorable position when faced with rapid ecosystem growth than competition between large communities issuing these learning credentials and other communities focused on different market verticals from government identity documents, commercial payments, and international trade, to name a few.

This specification opens a path forward for a unified concept of digital credentials in the 1EdTech community, collapsing the relevant differences between Open Badges and Comprehensive Learner Record (CLR), and addressing a clear set of single achievement use cases with a robust, flexible, and future-proof solution that can easily be integrated with the set-of-multiple credentials use cases familiar to CLR.

Below, we present a selection of benefits related to this restructuring of Open Badges, and compare the opportunities opened by becoming compatible with Verifiable Credentials to the limitations that the Open Badges community has encountered with previous versions of Open Badges and CLR.

#### 2.3.1 Interoperability with Digital Wallets, Verifiable Presentations, and Learner Experiences

[](#interoperability-with-digital-wallets-verifiable-presentations-and-learner-experiences)

Open Badges as VCs are designed to be issued and offered to learners who may accept them into their digital wallet. Wallets are software that runs on either the web or as a native app on a mobile device or desktop environment. A web wallet is another term to describe the application role known under [[OB-20](#bib-ob-20)] as a "Host". There is an existing and growing ecosystem of deployed technology to support VCs; integration with these becomes possible with this specification. For example, a number of generic Verifiable Credential wallet implementations are available from a variety of vendors as native mobile apps. From a wallet, recipients may package their badges along with their other VCs into verifiable presentations. A presentation contains the credentials that the learner wishes to share with a relying party. The digital wallet application digitally signs the presentation using the key of the learner. The verifying third-parties can cryptographically verify that the presentation came unmodified directly from the credential holder as well as the integrity of each of the VCs included in the presentation as credentials signed by each of their respective issuers.

It is possible from a wallet to package credentials into a verifiable presentation in response to a request from a relying party who seeks credentials for a certain purpose. For example, a potential employer seeking to fill an internship role, may need to verify that a student is over 18, has completed a course on communication, and is a current student. A student could use their wallet to package three VCs (driver's license, course completion badge, and student ID) into a presentation that is signed by their private key. When the presentation is sent to the employer's website, the employer can verify that the VCs belong to the student and that the VCs are authentic.

The growing collection of VC wallets is an example of how adopting a Verifiable Credentials-based approach allows Open Badges to grow in impact and take advantage of existing momentum in the digital credentials space around tooling that is entering the market and heading towards maturity.

#### 2.3.2 Verifiable Credentials Support Increases Learner Data Privacy and Trustworthiness of Open Badges

[](#verifiable-credentials-support-increases-learner-data-privacy-and-trustworthiness-of-open-badges)

The [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) specification describes how technologies can be used to present cryptographically verifiable and tamper-evident claims. Verifiable Credentials (VCs) can be verified through up-to-date and broadly interoperable schemas for verification. This can provide security and privacy enhancements to [1EdTech Open Badges](https://openbadgespec.org) that are not available in Open Badges 2.0.

Currently, Open Badges 2.0 data can be verified via either (a) publicly accessible hosted JSON badge data or (b) JWS digitally signed badges with a limited number of algorithms and key types, depending on the verification method chosen by the issuer. In order to keep up with evolving cryptographic standards without taking on the burden of writing cryptographic suites as a community not specializing in that function, adopting Verifiable Credentials proofs will allow experts to update algorithms to keep up with improvements to cryptography-breaking processing power.

Publicly hosted badge data has been the preferred method of many Open Badges issuers. This method can risk the privacy of badge recipients who are reliant on the issuers to host their data leaving them with no direct control over its accessibility. There is also the potential that data about individuals is publicly accessible without their knowledge. Most Open Badges don't contain significant amounts of personally identifiable information, but they are subject to correlation. This could lead to on-site identification, email spam, and also cause badges to be correlatable with other personally identifying data on the web.

Hosted badge data is also not tamper-evident since it is hosted on web servers typically as dynamically-generated JSON files populated by queries made to relational databases or static JSON files. This makes the data easy to change without any historic reference or preservation. This can be convenient for issuers but not assuring for relying third-parties seeking to put the data to use. Changes to badge metadata such as criteria, the issue date, and recipient email can reduce the perceived quality of data and reflect incorrect information about the learners' experiences. Digitally signed 2.0 badges provide more assurances and privacy than the hosted badges but are not commonly issued and are not interoperable with VC wallets.

There's been very little evidence that badge JSON data has been readily consumed by machines, but technologies and the education and workforce markets have evolved since [Open Badges v2.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v2p0/) was released in 2018. Machine learning and AI uses have expanded alongside blockchain and other decentralized technologies creating opportunity for connecting learners to opportunities, more accurate skills-based hiring, and updated curricula more equitably reflecting the needs of students. The market is demanding that the achievement data be trustworthy. This means that it should be accessible, protected, have integrity, and communicate what was intended including that the issuer and subjects of the data can be authenticated and that the data has not been tampered with since it was issued. Shifting Open Badges to align with the VC conventions to verify learner achievements meets these expectations and provides learners with more agency over their achievement data by giving them immediate access to it for as long as they need it, allowing them to choose which data they share, protecting it, and making it work with other credentials in and outside of education and workforce.

#### 2.3.3 Decentralized Identifiers and Self-Sovereign Identity

[](#decentralized-identifiers-and-self-sovereign-identity)

With Open Badges up to 2.0, email addresses have been used as identifiers far more commonly than the other available options. This has been problematic because email addresses may be used by more than one person, are often revoked when an individual leaves a job or school, are insecure, and aren't intended to be identifiers. Identifiers in VCs commonly are HTTP-based URLs, follow another scheme of IRI, or take the form of a [Decentralized Identifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/#intro).

Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) [[DID-CORE](#bib-did-core)] are a type of identifier for people, organizations and any other entity, where each identifier is controlled independently of centralized registries. Each DID can be resolved through an operation described by its particular "DID Method" to reveal a DID document that describes the subject. Whereas previous versions of Open Badges required HTTP(s) identifiers for issuers and typically used email (or rarely URL) identifiers for learners, adoption of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model provides simple conventions for badge issuers and recipients to begin to use DIDs when they desire.

Verification of control of identifiers is an important concept within any type of digital credential, both with respect to the issuer and the subject (recipient) of the credential. For issuers, Open Badges has relied on its own bespoke rules for determining whether a hosted Assertion URL or cryptographic key URL is associated with an issuer profile identified by a particular URL. URLs used for recipient identifiers have no built-in mechanism for authentication. Email and telephone number based recipient identifier authentication are up to the relying party, but there are common methods for performing this task essential to establishing trusted proof of control of credentials presented by a subject.

DIDs typically offer cryptographic proof of control, based on authorized keys or other verification methods expressed in the associated DID Document. While these protocols are not broadly implemented across domains today, the structure provides a forward-looking flexible and extensible mechanism to build the types of protocols needed to connect credentials back to the identities of their issuers and subjects. The Open Badges community may ultimately recommend use of only a small number of these capabilities in early releases or recommend them only for experimental use, like with cryptographic proof methods. But this is still an important step, because there is no reason for the Open Badges community to be closed to interoperability through the protocols being developed for use by the wallets and services coming into being elsewhere by delaying the option to use DIDs for recipient and issuer identifiers.

#### 2.3.4 Aligning Open Badges and CLR with Common Assertion and Achievement Models

[](#aligning-open-badges-and-clr-with-common-assertion-and-achievement-models)

As described below, it is possible for Open Badges and CLR to produce coordinated specs particularly if both specs are aligned with Verifiable Credentials. Discussion of the components of individual achievements can occur within the Open Badges workgroup, and discussion of more complex use cases necessitating needs for bundling and association of multiple achievements on behalf of a publisher can occur within the CLR group. The cross-pollination of members of each effort will create opportunities to coordinate and ensure that all important use cases for single assertions and bundles of associated assertions are well-handled. The openness of the Open Badges Specification can be preserved so that the broader community can continue to be aware of and connected to the official developments.

At the core, Open Badges and CLR have similar objectives with the primary difference being single vs a collection of credentials. A common assertion model ensures that Open Badges can be included in CLR collections and that both CLRs and Open Badges can be held separately by learners in their Verifiable Credential wallets.

Both Open Badges and CLR make assertions about achievements and conceptually share many similar properties. With some judicious analysis and renaming of some properties, it has been possible to have cross-alignment of achievement properties served by Open Badges and used by CLR. Examples include but are not limited to [achievementType](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementtype.class) which describes the type of achievement being represented, and [Result](#result)/[ResultDescription](#resultdescription) which can describe possible levels of mastery associated to specific achievements. This will enrich Open Badges data and increase the perceived significance and usage of Open Badges to deliver verifiable single achievements such as certifications, licenses, courses, etc. Using a common model across [[OB-30](#bib-ob-30)] and [[CLR-20](#bib-clr-20)] specifications for the core ideas of assertion and achievement will enable the CLR specification to focus on the more complex requirements of bundling collected assertions and expressing the associations between the achievements.

### 2.4 Achievement Credentials

[](#achievement-credentials)

The core claim enabled by Open Badges v3.0 is that of the [AchievementCredential](#achievementcredential), a Verifiable Credential that makes the claim that a subject (usually a learner), has met criteria an issuer has defined for a named Achievement. Standardizing this method of recognizing an achievement allows for issuers across the education and employment ecosystem to create Verifiable Credentials with consistent properties, so that wallets and verifiers can build broadly reusable software to interpret a wide range of use cases that fit into the defined achievement model. Verifiers of AchievementCredentials that are aware of a specific defined achievement SHOULD ensure that the issued AchievementCredential is issued by an issuer they trust to recognize this achievement, usually the creator of the achievement.

#### 2.4.1 Differentiating Issuers and Achievement Creators

[](#differentiating-issuers-and-achievement-creators)

In Open Badges and CLR, the issuer is assumed to be the creator. Over the years, the Open Badges community has requested capabilities to distinguish between the issuer and creator of a badge. This is because there are plenty of examples where the assessor is the issuer but not the creator of the badge. The [Original Creator Extensions](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/extensions/index.html#OriginalCreator) was a step in this direction but provides no properties to describe the eligibility of issuers trusted by the original creator to duplicate and issue their own assertions of the badge.

In order to open up a wide swath of use cases for shared issuing responsibility of common credentials, we can take advantage of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model to do more. Conveniently, an issuer property for the entity that is digitally signing the credential is included in the VC assertion. We may now separate the issuer from the creator of the Achievement/BadgeClass itself, and in the near term, we may open up use cases for creators to offer verifiable delegation of responsibility for achievement credential issuance. This will enable the use cases and give relying third-parties more contextual information about the achievement and the parties involved. When an Achievement does not include a reference to its creator, verifiers SHOULD interpret it as an entity associated with the credential issuer. Verifiers SHOULD ensure that they trust a particular credential's issuer to recognize the accomplishments described by the Achievement it contains. Verifiers SHOULD NOT trust that an issuer has accurately represented the creator or data of an achievement definition within a credential when that entity is authored by another party, but SHOULD understand that the data within the credential is the data the issuer wished to recognize, even if the verifier encounters a different representation of that data elsewhere.

### 2.5 Skill Assertions

[](#skill-assertions)

Many of the use cases for Open Badges and CLR involve an issuer's own "defined achievements", where an issuer bundles the details of an educational opportunity, assessment, and criteria they offer using the Achievement data class. In previous versions of Open Badges, the creator of an Achievement (known as a "BadgeClass") was the only entity that could issue it, but in v3.0, the door opens to many issuers recognizing the same achievement based on their own assessment. This practice of shared achievements enables skill assertions, where multiple issuers use a shared achievement definition to recognize achievement of a skill with each issuer doing their own assessment. In addition, further recording of related skills, competencies, standards, and other associations are enabled by the `alignment` of an Achievement.

A Skill Assertion is an AchievementCredential asserting a subject holds an Achievement that is used by multiple issuers to recognize the same skill. The content of the Achievement, often with `achievementType` "Competency", is not specific to a learning opportunity or assessment offered by one specific provider only, but is designed to be generic to allow for assessment by any issuer. Verifiers of AchievementCredentials who are looking for a holder to demonstrate a specific Achievement SHOULD ensure that they trust the issuer of a credential to make this claim, because a credential may be considered valid as issued by any issuer, including self-issuance by the subject.

## 3. Use Cases

[](#use-cases)
This section is non-normative.

The use cases below drive the design of Open Badges 3.0 specification.

### 3.1 Assertion Issuance to Wallet

[](#assertion-issuance-to-wallet)

Maya has completed an online course for an "Introduction to Web QA" at her local community college. The community college issues a course completion assertion. When Maya is ready to accept the assertion, she presents her wallet's location to the community college, which generates a request that Maya approves to receive the credential. Maya stores the assertion in her Verifiable Credentials enabled digital wallet with her other credentials.

Goal of the Primary Actor: Issue a verifiable credential to a student that she can use to take the next steps in her education journey.

Actors: Community college, Maya (student)

Preconditions for this Use Case:

- Community college creates badge for course completion

- Maya completes the course

- Maya downloads and installs a VC enabled digital wallet

- Maya has an identifier she uses for educational badges

- Maya is able to connect her wallet to the community college's issuing platform (assuming community college is using a platform) through authentication with the platform

- The community college has established an issuer profile, relevant cryptographic keys, and has published an Achievement corresponding to completion of the "Introduction to Web QA" course.

- Maya has provided an identifier to the college that it has accepted (or controls an identifier that the college has assigned to her)

Flow of Events:

- Maya completes course requirements, receives a grade and is marked as complete for the "Introduction to Web QA" course.

- Maya provides or selects an identifier to use as her identifier for badges while enrolled at the community college, and proves the identifier represents her to the college if necessary, and through mechanisms appropriate to the identifier type.

- The community college issues an assertion of the previously defined achievement to Maya's identifier and cryptographically signs it

- Maya accepts the credential into her wallet.

Alternative Flows:

The badge is issued to a parent or guardian of the recipient

- The school has Maya's parent or guardian identifier on record

- Maya completes the course

- The school issues an assertion to the parent or guardian identifier

- The parent or guardian accepts the credential into their wallet

### 3.2 Assertion Issuance Without a Wallet

[](#assertion-issuance-without-a-wallet)

A professional development/training vendor Training, Inc. recognizes Dawson's mastery of a competency by issuing an assertion to Dawson's email address.

Goal of the Primary Actor: Training, Inc. wishes to provide a verifiable record that Dawson may use to present proof of competency-based professional development.

Actors: Training, Inc (professional development/training vendor), Dawson (student)

Preconditions for this Use Case:

- Dawson is authenticated, associated with a particular email address to the vendor's platform.

- The vendor has established an issuer profile, defined an Achievement and has the capability to create and deliver assertions to Dawson via Badge Connect

Flow of Events:

- Dawson authenticates to the vendor platform, proving control of a chosen email address.

- Dawson connects a Badge Connect backpack to the vendor platform, resulting in the platform holding an auth token on his behalf scoped to allow pushing assertions to his backpack.

- Dawson engages with a learning opportunity, gains new knowledge, skills, and abilities, and successfully completes an assessment demonstrating mastery of a specific competency.

- Training, Inc. creates an assertion of the achievement that recognizes the competency.

- Training, Inc. transmits the assertion to Dawson's backpack via Badge Connect API.

Alternative Flows:

- Training, Inc. bakes the assertion into a PNG or SVG image file and transmits the image to Dawson who imports the baked badge into his backpack

- Training, Inc. encodes the assertion into a QR code transmits the QR code to Dawson who uses the backpack to scan the QR code and import the assertion

### 3.3 Recipient Presentation of Assertion

[](#recipient-presentation-of-assertion)

Maya registers for an advanced course and she is asked to provide proof that she completed a prerequisite course. From her wallet, Maya presents the course assertion as a verifiable presentation to the MOOC, which cryptographically verifies the issuer of the assertion, that Maya is the recipient, and that the assertion data has not been altered since it was issued. Upon verification, she is registered for the MOOC.

Editor's note
New to v3.0: Verifiable Credentials (VC) is a W3C specification that describes how to issue tamper-evident credentials that can be cryptographically verified. Maya's digital wallet has the capabilities to create a DID, read the VC data, and store it. From the wallet, Maya can present her credentials and prove that she is the recipient because it was issued to a DID that she created and has the digital keys that demonstrates her control of the Verifiable Credential (VC). This functionality is not specific to the Open Badges standard but using this verification functionality and using a decentralized identifier (DID) to identify the badge recipient instead of an email address is part of the v3.0 update. Maya's badge recognizes a course completion and being able to specify that in the badge is a new aspect of v3.0. As with the CLR, v3.0 will be able to specify the type of achievement that a badge is representing.

Goal of the Primary Actor: Register for advanced "Web QA" course

Actors: Maya, MOOC

Preconditions for this Use Case:

- Maya completed prerequisite course

- Issuer issued a verifiable assertion (i.e. completion of prerequisite course) to Maya

- Maya has a VC-compatible wallet

- Maya has received the VC representing her competion of the prerequisite course

- The MOOC is capable of receiving the verifiable presentation of the badge

Flow of Events:

- Maya authenticates to the MOOC platform

- The MOOC platform requests a credential matching a certain criteria (completion of a prerequisite course option)

- Maya prepares and transmits a presentation of her assertion to the MOOC platform

- The MOOC platform verifies the assertion is valid and fitting its needs

- The MOOC platform grants the authenticated user Maya access to the advanced course

Points of Failure:

- Maya's wallet and the MOOC platform must be capable of establishing a transmission channel for the assertion.

- The MOOC platform must be capable of expressing a request for a credential that matches the assertion that Maya holds.

- There must be a mutual capability between the wallet and the MOOC platform to prove Maya's is represented by recipient identifier

### 3.4 License Issuance

[](#license-issuance)

After Jeremy takes his electrician licensure exam, he accesses the online system for his state's licensure department to see his results and download his license. After he proves his identity by presenting his government issued ID from his digital wallet, he is informed that he passed the exam. The electrician license badge is issued to the DID Jeremy provided and is stored in his digital wallet with his other digital credentials.

Editor's note
New to v3.0: Similar to Maya's course completion badge, Jeremy's electrician license badge is also issued to a DID that Jeremy provides from his wallet and can also be cryptographically verified following the Verifiable Credentials model. The government issued ID in this use case is not an Open Badge but because it is a Verifiable Credential it can be stored in the same wallet as the electrician's license badge demonstrating interoperability of the verification models.

### 3.5 Single Skill Assertion

[](#single-skill-assertion)

From her school's LMS, Dr. Cara chooses which skills and competencies will be taught in her class. These skills and competencies are aligned with the rubric in the syllabus that is presented to her students. Once the students have successfully completed the course, Dr. Cara assesses each student's assignments and participation and selects which skills and competencies were met and at what level. The selection of skills and competencies triggers an issuing of a skill assertion for each one and includes the assessment results in the evidence and results. The skill assertions are associated with the student's IDs, the students are notified and informed how they can use these skill assessments to inform their choice of classes in the future.

Editor's note
New to v3.0: Single skill assertions are new to 3.0.

### 3.6 Mapping Skills

[](#mapping-skills)

Syd is shifting careers after many years working in construction. In their digital wallet they had several skill badges describing their mastery of skills in construction but also in teamwork, communication, and organizational skills. Syd also had badges from some courses they'd taken in science and math over the last few years. After they uploaded the skill and course badges from their wallet to a career planning site, they were offered several opportunities to apply for work in software sales and cybersecurity.

### 3.7 Verifying Continuing Education

[](#verifying-continuing-education)

Denise was offered a new job at a hospital as a physician's assistant. Before starting, her continuing education training and license to practice needed to be verified. The last time she switched hospitals, the verification process took three weeks. This time, she was able to provide her badges to prove her training and license. Within minutes her credentials were verified and she was issued a new digital staff credential.

Editor's note
New to v3.0: As with the other use case, this use case emphasizes that Open Badges v3.0 can recognize many different achievement types and be cryptographically verified following the Verifiable Credentials model.

### 3.8 Self-assertion

[](#self-assertion)

Stacy has created a mobile app that demonstrates her abilities as a coder, designer, and product manager. She creates an account on a badging platform and designs the badge to include alignments to the skills that the badge recognizes. With her digital wallet app, she connects to the badging platform and issues this badge to herself which includes screenshots and a link to the mobile app as evidence. Stacy uses this badge and others like it as verifiable portfolio items.

Editor's note
New to v3.0: In previous versions of Open Badges, it was possible to make self-assertion badges and issue badges to peers, however the issuer profile properties were organization specific. With 3.0, the issue properties can be modified to reference either an organization or an individual. It could be considered that both the issuer and recipient profile have similar optional properties so that there is flexibility in describing both profiles. This way, an organization could also be described as the recipient.

### 3.9 Endorsement

[](#endorsement)

Ralph has been issued a verifiable credential badge for his most recent position at the hospital where he works by the hospital. The badge contains alignments to the skills related to his role. He requests that his peers endorse the skills he has acquired. A platform is able to communicate this request to peers, facilitate review of the skills, and process the issuance of endorsement VC badges that reference the original badge, colleagues as endorsers, and Ralph as the recipient.

Editor's note
New to v3.0: In 2.0, an endorsement is its own type of assertion. In 3.0, an endorsement is its own type of credential. In the example above, the platform verifies the badge data and then acts as an issuer of endorsements on behalf of its users. It could also be that the platform uses AI to process the badge and sends an endorsement back to Ralph as a proof of acceptance and an evaluation of his badge.

### 3.10 Re-issue a

Leo earned several badges while in highschool and graduates soon. The email address used as the recipient identity for these badges was an email address provided by his high school and he will no longer have access to it. Leo downloads a digital wallet and requests that the school reissue the badges to the identifier he created in the wallet.

### 3.11 Authorization to Issue Given by Creator to Issuer

[](#authorization-to-issue-given-by-creator-to-issuer)

The data model attributes the issuer of a VC and the creator of the badge class separately.

Standards Organization X (SOX) has created a number of badges related to competencies they certify. SOX wants to authorize an accredited, certified training organization (CTO) to issue their credentials. An Open Badge Platform manages the granting of issuing rights to CTO by SOX and can issue verifiable credentials where CTO is the issuer and SOX is the creator inside the badge class.

Employer receives a credential from a graduate. Employer, in addition to verifying the VC in general, can review and verify that SOX did in fact authorize CTO to issue this badge.

### 3.12 Revocation of an Issued Credential

[](#revocation-of-an-issued-credential)

Gigantic State University is a badge issuer. It has awarded a badge to a student in the form of a verifiable credential. Some time after issuing the credential, GSU discovers academic misconduct on the part of the student and needs to revoke the credential's status. GSU updates a list of revoked credential IDs, noting the reason why it was revoked. Future verifications of the issued badge by consumers detect that the credential is now revoked and do not erroneously accept it.

Goal of the Primary Actor: Revoke a credential they have already awarded.

Actors: Credential issuer, Credential Subject, Consumer/Verifier

Preconditions for this Use Case:

- Issuer creates a badge class

- Issuer issues a credential to a subject

Credential references a revocation list

- Uses the credentialStatus property

- OB 3.0 standard comes to consensus on what to use

- Issuer has access to a revocation list to update

- Verification process of badge credentials checks associated list

### 3.13 Badge Class Status

[](#badge-class-status)

An institution has issued hundreds of badges in the form of VCs. A situation has arisen that requires the badge class to be effectively deleted or purged from the ecosystem. It is impractical (and arguably inaccurate) to revoke each assertion with individual records in perpetuity. The institution would like to set a status such that the badge class itself is treated as invalid.

## 4. Getting Started

[](#getting-started)

### 4.1 Implementation Guide

[](#implementation-guide)

The [Open Badges Implementation Guide v3.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/impl/) contains non-normative information on how to implement OB 3.0 and [CLR 2.0.](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/clr/v2p0)

## 5. Open Badges Document Formats

[](#docformat)
[OpenBadgeCredentials](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class) can be exchanged as documents as defined in this section, or by using the [Open Badges API](#api). Documents can be exchanged as a text file, a web resource, or embedded in an image. The contents of an Open Badge document MUST meet the following criteria:

- The contents of the file MUST represent exactly one [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class)

- The [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class) MUST be serialized as JSON and JSON-LD (see [§ A. Serialization](#serialization))

- JSON exchanged between systems that are not part of a closed ecosystem MUST be encoded using UTF-8 [[RFC3629](#bib-rfc3629)].

### 5.1 File Format

[](#file-format)

If the credential is signed using the [§ 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format](#jwt-proof) (VC-JWT) the contents of the file MUST be the [Compact JWS](#dfn-compact-jws) string formed as a result of signing the [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class) with VC-JWT. The file extension SHOULD be ".jws" or ".jwt".

If an embedded proof method is used instead, the contents of the file MUST be the JSON representation of the [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class). The file extension SHOULD be ".json".

### 5.2 Web Resource

[](#web-resource)

If the credential is signed using the [§ 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format](#jwt-proof) (VC-JWT) the contents of the response MUST be the [Compact JWS](#dfn-compact-jws) string formed as a result of signing the [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class) with VC-JWT. The `Content-Type` SHOULD be `text/plain`.

If an embedded proof method is used instead, the contents of the response MUST be the JSON representation of the [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class). The `Content-Type` SHOULD be `application/vc+ld+json`, although generic representations such `application/ld+json` or `application/json` are also allowed.

### 5.3 Baked Badge

[](#baked-badge)

OpenBadgeCredentials may be exchanged as image files with the credential encoded (baked) within. This allows the credential to be portable wherever image files may be stored or displayed.

"Baking" is the process of taking an [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class) and embedding it into the image, so that when a user displays the image on a page, software that is Open Badges aware can automatically extract that OpenBadgeCredential data and perform the checks necessary to see if a person legitimately earned the achievement within the image. The image MUST be in either PNG [[PNG](#bib-png)] or SVG [[SVG11](#bib-svg11)] format in order to support baking.

#### 5.3.1 PNG

[](#png)

##### 5.3.1.1 Baking

[](#png-baking)
An [`iTXt`](http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11iTXt) chunk should be inserted into the PNG with keyword `openbadgecredential`.

If the credential is signed using the [§ 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format](#jwt-proof) (VC-JWT) the text value of the chunk MUST be the [Compact JWS](#dfn-compact-jws) string formed as a result of signing the [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class) with VC-JWT. Compression MUST NOT be used.

    [Example 2](#example-an-example-of-creating-a-chunk-with-vc-jwt-proof-assuming-an-itxt-constructor): An example of creating a chunk with VC-JWT proof (assuming an iTXt constructor)

```
var chunk = new iTXt({
  keyword: 'openbadgecredential',
  compression: 0,
  compressionMethod: 0,
  languageTag: '',
  translatedKeyword: '',
  text: 'header.payload.signature'
})
```

If an embedded proof method is used instead, the text value of the chunk MUST be the JSON representation of the [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class). Compression MUST NOT be used.

    [Example 3](#example-an-example-of-creating-a-chunk-with-embedded-proof-assuming-an-itxt-constructor): An example of creating a chunk with embedded proof (assuming an iTXt constructor)

```
var chunk = new iTXt({
  keyword: 'openbadgecredential',
  compression: 0,
  compressionMethod: 0,
  languageTag: '',
  translatedKeyword: '',
  text: '{
          "@context": [
            "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
            "https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/context-3.0.3.json"
          ],
          "id": "http://example.edu/credentials/3732",
          "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "OpenBadgeCredential"],
          "issuer": {
            "id": "https://example.edu/issuers/565049",
            "type": "Profile",
            "name": "Example University"
          },
          "validFrom": "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z",
          "credentialSubject": {
            "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21"
          },
          "proof": { }
        }'
})
```

An iTXt chunk with the keyword `openbadgecredential` MUST NOT appear in a PNG more than once. When baking an image that already contains credential data, the implementer may choose whether to pass the user an error or overwrite the existing chunk.

##### 5.3.1.2 Extracting

[](#png-extracting)
Parse the PNG datastream until the first [`iTXt`](http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11iTXt) chunk is found with the keyword `openbadgecredential`. The rest of the stream can be safely discarded. The text portion of the iTXt will either be the JSON representation of a [§ B.1.2 AchievementCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class) or the [Compact JWS](#dfn-compact-jws) string that was the result of signing the [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class) with [§ 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format](#jwt-proof).

#### 5.3.2 SVG

[](#svg)

##### 5.3.2.1 Baking

[](#svg-baking)
First, add an `xmlns:openbadges` attribute to the `tag with the value "[https://purl.imsglobal.org/ob/v3p0](https://purl.imsglobal.org/ob/v3p0)". Directly after the` tag, add an `` tag.

If the credential is signed using the [§ 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format](#jwt-proof) (VC-JWT) add a `verify` attribute to the ``tag. The value of`verify` attribute MUST be the [Compact JWS](#dfn-compact-jws) string formed as a result of signing the [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class) with VC-JWT.

    [Example 4](#example-an-example-of-a-well-baked-svg-with-vc-jwt-proof): An example of a well baked SVG with VC-JWT proof

```
"1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?]
svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:openbadges="https://purl.imsglobal.org/ob/v3p0"
  viewBox="0 0 512 512"]
  openbadges:credential verify="header.payload.signature"]openbadges:credential]


svg]
```

If an embedded proof method is used instead, omit the `verify` attribute, and the JSON representation of the [OpenBadgeCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class) MUST go into the body of the tag, wrapped in ``.

    [Example 5](#example-an-example-of-a-well-baked-svg-with-embedded-proof): An example of a well baked SVG with embedded proof

```
"1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?]
svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:openbadges="https://purl.imsglobal.org/ob/v3p0"
  viewBox="0 0 512 512"]
  openbadges:credential]

  openbadges:credential]


svg]
```

There MUST be only one `` tag in an SVG. When baking an image that already contains OpenBadgeCredential data, the implementer may choose whether to pass the user an error or overwrite the existing tag.

##### 5.3.2.2 Extracting

[](#extracting)

Parse the SVG until you reach the first `` tag. The rest of the SVG data can safely be discarded.

## 6. Open Badges API

[](#api)

        [Open Badges](#dfn-open-badge) can be exchanged using the API (application programming interface)
        defined here, or as
        [documents](#docformat).


        This specification defines a [RESTful API](#dfn-restful-api) protocol to be implemented by
        applications serving in the roles of [Client](#dfn-consumer) and [Resource Server](#dfn-provider). The API
        uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and granular resource-based permission scopes.
        Please see the [Open Badges Specification Conformance and Certification Guide v3.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/cert/) for a list of which endpoints must be implemented
        for certification.

    Note: Non-individual access
        The API defined here is intended for [Clients](#dfn-consumer) and [servers](#dfn-platform) that give
        individual users control over access to their resources. While system-to-system
        bulk transfers using OAuth 2.0 Client-Credentials Grant are expected to occur, it
        is out of scope for this version of the specification to define. Future versions
        of this specification may add explicit support for OAuth 2.0 Client-Credentials
        Grant.


        In addition to the documentation in this section, there are
        [OpenAPI](#docs-openapi) files for the Open Badges API in both JSON and
        YAML format:




            [JSON OpenAPI File](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/openapi/imsob_v3p0.json)


            [YAML OpenAPI File](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/schema/openapi/imsob_v3p0.yaml)


### 6.1 Architecture

[](#architecture)

            [Figure 4](#ad-architecture)
                Diagram showing the major components of the Open Badges API




There are five key components to the API architecture.

            User

                This is the user that owns the resources ([badges](#dfn-open-badge)) that are on the
                [resource server](#dfn-provider). Also called a Resource Owner.

            Web Browser
            This is the web browser the [user](#dfn-resource-owner) interacts with.
            [Client](#dfn-consumer)

                This is the web application that interacts with the [resource server](#dfn-provider) on
                behalf of the [user](#dfn-resource-owner). Also called Consumer in the [IMS Global Security Framework v1.1](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p1/).

            Authorization Server

                This is a [server](#dfn-platform) that implements the OAuth 2.0 endpoints on behalf of
                the [resource server](#dfn-provider). In many systems, the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) and
                the [resource server](#dfn-provider) are combined.

            Resource Server

                This is the [server](#dfn-platform) that has the protected resources ([badges](#dfn-open-badge)). Also
                called Provider in the [IMS Global Security Framework v1.1](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p1/).



            The role of each component during Registration, Obtaining Tokens, and
            Authenticating with Tokens are described below.


### 6.2 Secure REST Endpoints

[](#api-endpoints)
These endpoints are used to exchange OpenBadgeCredentials and Profile information.

            All secure endpoint requests MUST be made over secure TLS 1.2 or 1.3 protocol.


            All of the Secure REST Endpoints are protected by OAuth 2.0 access tokens as
            described in [§ 7. Open Badges API Security](#api-security).




#### 6.2.1 Scopes

[](#scopes)

            Each endpoint requires an access token with a specific Open Badges scope as
            shown below.




                    Operation

### 6.4 Paging

[](#paging-0)

            Pagination of `getCredentials` results is controlled by two query
            string parameters appended to the request. The response includes the following
            pagination headers.




                    Response Header
                    Description
                    Required




                    `X-Total-Count: `

                        The [resource server](#dfn-provider) MUST include an
                        `X-Total-Count` response header if the total result
                        count is known. If the total result count is not known, the total
                        count header MUST be ommitted.

                    Conditionally Required for `200 OK` Response


                    `Link: `

                        The [resource server](#dfn-provider) MUST include a
                        `[Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link)`
                        response header if the list of credentials in the response is
                        incomplete; and MAY include the
                        `Link` header if the response is complete.

                    Conditionally Required for `200 OK` Response




            If present, the `Link` header MUST support all of the following
            link relations (`rel` values):




                    Relation
                    Description




                    next

                        The link relation for the immediate next page of results. This
                        MUST appear when the current list response is incomplete.



                    last

                        The link relation for the last page of results. This MUST always
                        appear.



                    first

                        The link relation for the first page of results. This MUST always
                        appear.



                    prev

                        The link relation for the immediate previous page of results. This
                        MUST appear when the offset is greater than zero.





### 6.5 Retry Behavior

[](#retry-behavior-0)

            [Resource Servers](#dfn-provider) MAY implement a `Retry-After` header to
            indicate a period of time to wait before attempting the request again.


            If no `Retry-After` header is present and the response is non-2XX,
            it is recommended to retry the request in 30 minutes for an additional two
            attempts. After which, it MAY be desirable to alert the [user](#dfn-resource-owner) that there is
            an issue with the connection (e.g. perhaps they need to reauthenticate or
            manually trigger the request when they believe services are back up).


## 7. Open Badges API Security

[](#api-security)

    The [Open Badges API](#api) endpoints use the methods outlined in [Section 4, "Securing Web Services"](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p1/#securing-web-services) of the [IMS Global Security Framework v1.1](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p1/). [Clients](#dfn-consumer) and [servers](#dfn-platform) that give
    individual users control over access to their resources MUST use the OAuth 2.0 Authorization
      Code Grant method.

Note: Non-individual access
The API defined here is intended for [Clients](#dfn-consumer) and [servers](#dfn-platform) that give individual users control over access to their resources.
While system-to-system bulk transfers using OAuth 2.0 Client-Credentials Grant are expected to occur, it is out of scope for this version of the specification to define. Future versions of this specification may add explicit support for OAuth 2.0 Client-Credentials Grant.

### 7.1 Using OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant

[](#oauth2acg)

      Making a secured Open Badges API request using authorization code grant comprises three steps:




        [§ 7.1.1 Dynamic Client Registration](#dynamic-registration) - Share configuration information between the [client](#dfn-consumer) and the [server](#dfn-platform).
        This is typically done only once unless the registration is revoked.


        [§ 7.1.2 Obtaining Tokens](#acg-tokens) - Obtain an authorization code using a choreography between the [client](#dfn-consumer), [web browser](#dfn-web-browser), [user](#dfn-resource-owner), and [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server). Then request an access token by sending a request,
        using the previously obtained authorization code, to the Access Token service endpoint.


        [§ 7.1.3 Authenticating with Tokens](#acg-authenticating) - Use the access token in the Authorization header of the API request.


#### 7.1.1 Dynamic Client Registration

[](#dynamic-registration)

        To get started, the [client](#dfn-consumer) and [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) MUST share the four pieces of information
        shown below using the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [[RFC7591](#bib-rfc7591)] as described in this
        section.


        client_id

          This is the public identifier for the communication exchange. Also called a Secret in the
          [IMS Global Security Framework v1.1](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p1/).

        client_secret

          This is the shared secret for the communication exchange. Also called a Secret in the [IMS Global Security Framework v1.1](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p1/).

        List of Scopes

          The list of scopes that identify the set of endpoints for which access permission is being
          requested.

        OAuth 2.0 Access Token Service Endpoint

          The endpoint from which the approved, requesting [client](#dfn-consumer) can obtain an access token.



        If the [client](#dfn-consumer) and [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) support Token Revocation, they should also share:


        OAuth 2.0 Revocation Service Endpoint

          The endpoint a [client](#dfn-consumer) can use to revoke an access token.




There are two steps to dynamic client registration:

        - Request a Service Description Document (SDD) from the [resource server](#dfn-provider)

        - Register with the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server)





        [Figure 5](#fig-sequence-diagram-for-dynamic-client-registration) Sequence diagram for dynamic client registration


        The [client](#dfn-consumer) only needs to register a `client_id` with the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server)
        once. Each [user](#dfn-resource-owner) will use the same `client_id` when they request their own
        authorization code.




##### 7.1.1.1 Request the Service Description Document

[](#request-the-service-description-document)

        To start the registration process, the [user](#dfn-resource-owner) supplies the [client](#dfn-consumer) with the [resource server](#dfn-provider)'s base URL. When presented with an unknown [resource server](#dfn-provider) the [client](#dfn-consumer) MUST request
        the [resource server](#dfn-provider)'s Service Description Document (SDD) at the path
        `{baseUrl}/ims/ob/v3p0/discovery`. Rate-limited access to this endpoint is RECOMMENDED.
        An example request for an SDD takes the form of:



    [Example 16](#example-sample-request-for-a-service-description-document): Sample request for a service description document

```
GET /tenant/ims/ob/v3p0/discovery HTTP/1.1
Host: 1edtech.org
Accept: application/json
```

        Access to the discovery endpoint MUST NOT be protected. The SDD MUST be provided over HTTPS with TLS
        1.2 or 1.3.


        The response to this request is the SDD supplied as a JSON encoded payload. The structure and format
        of this payload MUST follow that of the OpenAPI 3.0 Specification [[OPENAPIS-3.0](#bib-openapis-3.0)]. The SDD supplied
        MUST be a profiled version of the OpenAPI 3.0 (JSON) file provided with this specification (see
        [§ 1.2.1 OpenAPI 3.0 Files](#docs-openapi)). The profiled version contains all of the details about the supported set of
        service end-points, the supported optional data fields, definitions of the proprietary data fields
        supplied using the permitted extension mechanisms, definitions of the available proprietary
        endpoints, and information about the security mechanisms.


        The `x-imssf-privacyPolicyUrl` property is inserted into the `securitySchemes`
        within the `components` section of the OpenAPI file structure. This is an 1EdTech controlled
        extension to the OpenAPI specification.




            Property Name
            Type
            Description
            Required




            `x-imssf-privacyPolicyUrl`
            [URL](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.derived.url.class)
            A fully qualified URL to the [resource server](#dfn-provider)'s privacy policy.
            Required




        The `x-imssf-image` and `x-imssf-privacyPolicy` properties are inserted into
        the `info` section of the OpenAPI file structure. These are also 1EdTech controlled
        extensions to the OpenAPI specification. Also note that the standard `title` and
        `termsOfService` property is required in a Service Description Document. These may be
        displayed to the [user](#dfn-resource-owner) during the registration process.




            Property Name
            Type
            Description
            Required




            `x-imssf-image`
            [URI](#uri)

              An image representing the [resource server](#dfn-provider). May be a Data URI or the URL where the
              image may be found.

            Optional


            `x-imssf-privacyPolicyUrl`
            [URL](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.derived.url.class)
            A fully qualified URL to the [resource server](#dfn-provider)'s privacy policy.
            Required


            `title`
            [String](#string)
            The name of the [resource server](#dfn-provider).
            Required


            `termsOfService`
            [URL](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.derived.url.class)
            A fully qualified URL to the [resource server](#dfn-provider)'s terms of service.
            Required

```

        Upon receiving a SDD from a [resource server](#dfn-provider), the [client](#dfn-consumer) SHOULD respect the Cache-Control and
        Expires headers if present in the response and configure local cache to match the directives it
        declares. If directives include one of `no-cache`, `no-store`, the [client](#dfn-consumer)
        SHOULD NOT cache the data for future interactions. If directives include `max-age` or if
        an Expires header is present, the [client](#dfn-consumer) SHOULD cache the SDD data, if valid, up to the
        expiration indicated, either at the time indicated by the Expires header or max-age seconds from
        request time.


        An Etag header MAY be offered with the SDD response. If so, after a resource's declared expiration,
        a [client](#dfn-consumer) MAY include an `If-None-Match header` containing the value of the Etag to
        check if the resource is still fresh. If so the [resource server](#dfn-provider) may return a
        `304 Not Modified` response status code, and a new `Expires` or
        `Cache-Control` header MAY be included, which the [client](#dfn-consumer) SHOULD use to update the
        cache expiration.

        With the Registration URL in hand (the value of the `x-imssf-registrationUrl` property of
        the SDD), the [client](#dfn-consumer) SHOULD post a registration request to the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server). The
        registration request MUST comply with OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [[RFC7591](#bib-rfc7591)].
        The registration request MUST NOT require an Initial Access Token. Use of the 'Software Statement'
        is NOT RECOMMENDED. The client registration request is sent to the Client Registration URL. The
        request MUST be sent using HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or 1.3 protocol.


        The properties of the JSON body MUST be implemented as described in the following table. All URLs
        MUST use HTTPS (e.g. https://1edtech.org/logo.png) and all URLs MUST have the same hostname. All
        required properties MUST be present in the registration request in order for it to be accepted by
        the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server). Arrays MUST be used even when a single value is to be sent.

        If the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) accepts the registration request, it will store the information
        provided in the request and respond `HTTP 201 Created` with a registration response that
        includes a set of client credentials for the [client](#dfn-consumer) application to use when requesting access
        tokens. All the information provided by the [client](#dfn-consumer) application MUST be returned to the
        [client](#dfn-consumer) application, including modifications to the properties as the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server)
        deems necessary. An example response looks like this:

        The following table describes the properties present in the client registration response that were
        not included in the request. These are all REQUIRED properties.




            Name
            Type
            Description
            Required




            `client_id`
            [String](#string)

              An OAuth 2.0 client identifier string. The value SHOULD NOT be currently valid for any

#### 7.1.2 Obtaining Tokens

[](#acg-tokens)

        [Figure 6](#fig-sequence-diagram-for-obtaining-access-tokens-when-using-the-acg-flow) Sequence diagram for obtaining access tokens when using the ACG flow


        Obtaining an access token using an authorization code has two steps:




          First obtain an authorization code using a choreography between the [client](#dfn-consumer), [web browser](#dfn-web-browser),
          [user](#dfn-resource-owner), and [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) - [§ 7.1.2.1 Authorization Request](#acg-auth-request)


          Then request an access token using the authorization code - [§ 7.1.2.3 Access Token Request](#acg-token-request)




        Once obtained, the [client](#dfn-consumer) can freely re-use the access token up until the token's expiry time, so
        that the [client](#dfn-consumer) need not repeat steps of obtaining an authorization code and requesting an access
        token for every API request. Token refresh is also available (see [§ 7.2.1 Token Refresh Request](#token-refresh-request)).




##### 7.1.2.1 Authorization Request

[](#acg-auth-request)

        After the [client](#dfn-consumer) application is registered with the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) as described in
        [§ 7.1.1 Dynamic Client Registration](#dynamic-registration), the [client](#dfn-consumer) application then MAY initiate an authorization request
        as described in Section 4.2 of the IMS Security Framework [[SEC-11](#bib-sec-11)] by redirecting the user to the
        `authorizationUrl` as declared in the [resource server](#dfn-provider)'s Service Description Document
        (SDD).


        In the OAuth 2.0 Security Best Practices document [[OAUTH2-SBP](#bib-oauth2-sbp)] the use of Proof Key for Code
        Exchange (PKCE) [[RFC7636](#bib-rfc7636)] is recommended in order to (with the help of the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server)) detect and prevent attempts to inject (replay) authorization codes into the authorization
        response. When using 1EdTech specifications, PKCE MUST be used to protect Authorization Code Grant based
        access. The PKCE has two stages:



          First the [client](#dfn-consumer) MUST supply a `code_challenge` and
          `code_challenge_method` in the request for an authorization code. The [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) is responsible for associating the `code_challenge` with the issued
          authorization code.


          Then the [client](#dfn-consumer) MUST supply the `code_verifier` in the Access Token Request, and
          the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) verifies the `code_verifier`.








            Parameter Name
            Type
            Description
            Required




            `response_type`
            [String](#string)
            Value MUST be set to "code".
            Required


            `client_id`
            [String](#string)

              The [client](#dfn-consumer) application identifier. MUST be the `client_id` provided
              in
              the Dynamic Client Registration [§ 7.1.1.2 Register with Authorization Server](#register-with-authorization-server) response.

            Required


            `redirect_uri`
            [URL](#url)

              The [client](#dfn-consumer) application's redirection endpoint. MUST match one of the
              `redirect_uris` in the [§ 7.1.1 Dynamic Client Registration](#dynamic-registration) request. Although this is
              optional in the IMS Security Framework [[SEC-11](#bib-sec-11)], it is REQUIRED by this
              specification.

            Required


            `scope`
            [String](#string)

              The scope of the authorization request. The [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) is responsible
              for
              validating the scopes identified in the request and the response MUST include a
              scope
              parameter which confirms this list or comprises a subset of the services requested.

            Required


            `state`
            [String](#string)

              An opaque value used by the [client](#dfn-consumer) application to maintain state between the
              request
              and callback. The [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) includes this value when redirecting the
              [web browser](#dfn-web-browser) back to the [client](#dfn-consumer). This parameter MUST be used for preventing
              cross-site request forgery.

            Required


            `code_challenge`
            [String](#string)
            This is BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier))).
            Required


            `code_challenge_method`
            [String](#string)

              This MUST have a value of "S256" to indicate the SHA256 code verifier transformation
              method is used.

            Required




        All of the authorization request parameters are encoded in the authorization request as query
        string parameters. The request MUST be made by redirecting the browser to the OAuth 2.0
        Authorization endpoint. The request MUST use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or 1.3 protocol.

##### 7.1.2.2 Authorization Response

[](#acg-auth-response)

        If the `redirect_uri` matches a known `client_id`, the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) SHOULD present a UI asking the [user](#dfn-resource-owner) to authenticate themself and grant the access
        request. The [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) SHOULD display the `client_name`,
        `client_uri`, `logo_uri`, `tos_uri`, and `policy_uri`
        collected during Dynamic Client Registration to the [user](#dfn-resource-owner) to help them decide whether to grant
        the access request.


        If the [user](#dfn-resource-owner) authorizes the [client](#dfn-consumer) application to access their resources with the requested
        scopes, the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) MUST redirect the browser back to the `redirect_uri`
        with the `code`, `scope`, and `state` query string parameters.


        The Authorization Code MUST be used only once. A lifetime for the authorization code of 600 seconds
        (10 minutes) is RECOMMENDED. If an authorization code is used more than once, the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) MUST deny the request and SHOULD revoke (when possible) all tokens previously issued based
        on that authorization code. The authorization code is bound to the [client](#dfn-consumer) identifier and
        redirection URI.



          Parameter Name
          Type
          Description
          Required



            `code`
            [String](#string)
            The authorization code.
            Required


            `scope`
            [String](#string)

              The authorized scope for the access request (this MAY be a subset of the scopes in the
              request). The value is a space delimited set of scopes.

            Required


            `state`
            [String](#string)

              The opaque value supplied by the client to maintain state between the request and
              callback.

            Required

###### 7.1.2.2.1 Authorization Error Response

[](#authorization-error-response)

        If the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) does not recognize the [client](#dfn-consumer) applications's redirection
        endpoint from a prior connection with this [client](#dfn-consumer) application, the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server)
        SHOULD inform the [user](#dfn-resource-owner) of the error and MUST NOT automatically redirect to the [web browser](#dfn-web-browser)
        to the invalid redirection URI.


        If the [user](#dfn-resource-owner) denies the authorization request or if the request fails for reasons other than a
        missing or invalid redirection URI, the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) informs the [client](#dfn-consumer) by adding
        the following parameters to the query component of the redirection URI.




            Parameter Name
            Type

              A URI identifying a human-readable web page with information about the error, used to
              provide the client developer with additional information about the error. Values for the
              "error_uri" parameter MUST conform to the URI-reference syntax and thus MUST NOT include
              characters outside the set %x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E.



            `state`
            [String](#string)

              The opaque value supplied by the client to maintain state between the request and
              callback.

            Required





    [Example 22](#example-sample-authorization-error-response): Sample authorization error response

```

##### 7.1.2.3 Access Token Request

[](#acg-token-request)

        With the supplied `code`, the [client](#dfn-consumer) application SHOULD attempt to exchange the
        `code` for an `access_token`. The [client](#dfn-consumer) application makes an
        authorization grant POST request to the `tokenUrl` as declared in the [resource server](#dfn-provider)'s Discovery Document. The HTTP POST request MUST include a Basic authorization header with
        the `client_id` and `client_secret` provided in the registration response. The
        body of the token request MUST include the following form fields:




            Field Name
            Type
            Description
            Required




            `grant_type`

##### 7.1.2.4 Access Token Response

[](#acg-token-response)

        If the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) grants this request (see Section 5.1 in [[RFC6749](#bib-rfc6749)] for the detailed
        description), it returns `HTTP 200 OK` status code with content type "application/json"
        consisting of a JSON object containing the access token and its expiry lifetime (1EdTech recommends a
        default expiry lifetime of 3600 seconds, one hour, for access tokens), optionally a refresh token,
        and confirms the set of scopes supported by the access token:




            Property Name
            Type
            Description
            Required


            `access_token`
            [String](#string)
            The access token issued by the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server).
            Required


            `token_type`
            [String](#string)
            The type of the token issued. The case insensitive value MUST be "bearer".
            Required


            `scope`
            [String](#string)
            The scope of the access token. This is a space-separated list of scopes.
            Required


            `expires_in`
            [PositiveInteger](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.primitive.positiveinteger.class)

              The lifetime in seconds of the access token. For example, the value "3600" denotes that
              the access token will expire in one hour from the time the response was generated. 1EdTech
              recommends a default expiry lifetime of 3600 seconds, one hour, for access tokens. If
              omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the expiration time via other means or
              document the default value.

            Optional


            `refresh_token`
            [String](#string)

              The refresh token, which can be used to obtain new access tokens using the same
              authorization grant as described in [§ 7.2.1 Token Refresh Request](#token-refresh-request).

            Optional

```

###### 7.1.2.4.1 Access Token Error Response

[](#acg-token-error)

        The [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) MAY decide not to issue an access token. This could be because the
        request scopes are invalid, the credentials from the client may be invalid, etc. In this case the
        [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) MUST return an `HTTP 400 Bad Request` status code with content
        type "application/json" consisting of a JSON object describing the error in the response body. The
        properties used to describe the error are:




            Property Name
            Type
            Description
            Required




            `error`
            [TokenError](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.tokenerror.class)
            A single ASCII [[RFC20](#bib-rfc20)] error code]. See Section 5.2 of [[RFC6749](#bib-rfc6749)].
            Required


            `error_description`
            [ASCIIString](#asciistring)

              Human-readable ASCII [RFC20] text providing additional information, used to assist the
              client developer in understanding the error that occurred. Values for the
              "error_description" parameter MUST NOT include characters outside the set %x20-21 /
              %x23-5B / %x5D-7E.

            Optional


            `error_uri`
            [URI](#uri)

              A URI identifying a human-readable web page with information about the error, used to
              provide the client developer with additional information about the error. Values for the
              "error_uri" parameter MUST conform to the URI-reference syntax and thus MUST NOT include
              characters outside the set %x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E.

            Optional





    [Example 25](#example-sample-access-token-error-response): Sample access token error response

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "error": "invalid_request"
}
```

#### 7.1.3 Authenticating with Tokens

[](#acg-authenticating)

        After obtaining an `access_token` and optionally a `refresh_token` using the
        method above, a [client](#dfn-consumer) application MAY issue request that access resources controlled by the
        [user](#dfn-resource-owner) on the [resource server](#dfn-provider) using the `access_token` in the HTTP Authorization header
        [[RFC2617](#bib-rfc2617)] with a Bearer Token [[RFC6750](#bib-rfc6750)]. For example, a [getCredentials](#getcredentials)
        request would look like this:



    [Example 26](#example-sample-getcredentials-request-0): Sample getCredentials request

```
GET /ims/ob/v3p0/credentials HTTP/1.1
Host: example.edu
Authorization: Bearer 863DF0B10F5D432EB2933C2A37CD3135A7BB7B07A68F65D92
Accept: application/json
```

### 7.2 Token Refresh

[](#token-refresh)

      The recommended value of the access token's `expires_in` attribute is 3600 i.e. one hour. This
      means that the validity of the access token expires one hour after the time it was issued.


      When requesting an access token as part of the Authorization Code Grant process, an [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server)
      MAY return a 'Refresh Token'. The refresh token can be used to obtain an access token using the same
      authorization grant: this is described in Section 6 of [[RFC6749](#bib-rfc6749)]. The use of the Refresh Token avoids the
      choreography for obtaining the credentials to gain access to the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server).


      An Authorization Server is NOT REQUIRED to support token refresh.

#### 7.2.1 Token Refresh Request

[](#token-refresh-request)

      If the `access_token` is expired or about to expire, and the [client](#dfn-consumer) application received
      a `refresh_token`, the [client](#dfn-consumer) application can use OAuth 2.0 Token Refresh to get a new
      `access_token` and `refresh_token`.


      The [client](#dfn-consumer) makes a refresh POST request to the token endpoint by adding the following parameters
      using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format in the HTTP request entity-body:




          Parameter Name
          Type
          Description
          Required




          `grant_type`
          [String](#string)
          Value MUST be set to "refresh_token".
          Required


          `refresh_token`
          [String](#string)
          The refresh token issued to the [client](#dfn-consumer).
          Required


          `scope`
          [String](#string)

            The scope of the access request. The requested scope MUST NOT include any scope not
            originally granted by the [user](#dfn-resource-owner), and if omitted is treated as equal to the scope
            originally granted by the [user](#dfn-resource-owner).

          Required





    [Example 27](#example-sample-acg-token-refresh-request-line-breaks-for-clarity): Sample ACG token refresh request (line breaks for clarity)

```
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: auth.1edtech.org
Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token
  &refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA
  &scope=https%3A%2F%2Fpurl.imsglobal.org%2Fspec%2Fob%2Fv3p0%2Fscope%2credential.readonly
```

#### 7.2.2 Token Refresh Response

[](#token-refresh-response)

      If valid and authorized, the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) issues a new access token and optionally a new
      refresh token as described earlier in [§ 7.1.2.4 Access Token Response](#acg-token-response). If the request failed verification or
      is invalid, the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) returns an error response as described earlier in
      [§ 7.1.2.4.1 Access Token Error Response](#acg-token-error).

### 7.3 Token Revocation

[](#token-revocation)

      There may be deployments in which revocation of an access token is useful. The Token Revocation process is
      based upon [[RFC7009](#bib-rfc7009)]. The [client](#dfn-consumer) requests the revocation of a particular token by making an HTTP POST
      request (using TLS) to the token revocation endpoint URL. Note that [[RFC7009](#bib-rfc7009)] states that implementations
      MUST support the revocation of refresh tokens and SHOULD support the revocation of access tokens.

#### 7.3.1 Token Revocation Request

[](#revocation-request)

      The [client](#dfn-consumer) constructs the request by including the following parameters using the
      "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format in the HTTP request entity-body:




          Parameter Name
          Type
          Description
          Required




          `token`
          [String](#string)
          The token that the [client](#dfn-consumer) wants to get revoked.
          Required


          `token_type_hint`
          [String](#string)
          MUST be set to either "access_token" or "refresh_token".
          Required





    [Example 28](#example-sample-token-revocation-request): Sample token revocation request

```
POST /revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: auth.1edtech.org
Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

token=45ghiukldjahdnhzdauz&token_type_hint=refresh_token
```

#### 7.3.2 Token Revocation Response

[](#revocation-response)

      The [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) responds with `HTTP 200 OK` status code if the token has been
      revoked successfully or if the client submitted an invalid token.


      When the request for revocation is rejected, the [authorization server](#dfn-authorization-server) returns an error response as
      described earlier in [§ 7.1.2.4.1 Access Token Error Response](#acg-token-error) with an `error` code of "unsupported_token_type".

## 8. Proofs (Signatures)

[](#data-integrity)
This section describes mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of OpenBadgeCredentials. At least one proof mechanism, and the details necessary to evaluate that proof, MUST be expressed for a [credential](#dfn-credential) to be a [verifiable credential](#dfn-vc); that is, to be [verifiable](#dfn-verifiable). In order to pass 1EdTech conformance tests, issuers MUST use a proof mechanism supported by the 1EdTech conformance test suite. See more about [Selecting proof methods and crypto algorithms](impl#selecting-proof-methods-and-crypto-algorithms) in the Implementation Guide.

### 8.1 Proof Formats

[](#proof-formats)

The proof formats included in this specification fall into two categories:

- JSON Web Token Proof - Sometimes called VC-JWT, this format has a single implementation: the credential is encoded into a [JWT](#dfn-jwt) which is then signed and encoded as a [JWS](#dfn-jws). The JSON Web Token proof is called an external proof because the proof wraps the [credential](#dfn-credential) object.

- Linked Data Proofs - The credential is signed and the signature is used to form a [Proof](#proof) object which is appended to the credential. This format supports many different proof types. These are called embedded proofs because the proof is embedded in the data.

Note
The [issuer](#dfn-issuer) MAY use multiple proofs. If multiple proofs are provided, the [verifier](#dfn-verifier) MAY use any one proof to verify the credential.

A third category of proof format called Non-Signature Proof is not covered by this specification. This category includes proofs such as proof of work.

### 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format

[](#jwt-proof)
This proof format relies on the well established JWT (JSON Web Token) [[RFC7519](#bib-rfc7519)] and JWS (JSON Web Signature) [[RFC7515](#bib-rfc7515)] specifications. A JSON Web Token Proof is a JWT signed and encoded as a [Compact JWS](#dfn-compact-jws) string. The proof format is described in detail in [[VC-JOSE-COSE](#bib-vc-jose-cose)], referred from Section 5.13 "Securing Mechanism Specifications" of [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/). That description allows several options which may inhibit interoperability. This specification limits the options while maintaining compatibility with [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0](#bib-vc-data-model-2.0)] to help ensure interoperability.

Note
At the time of the completion of this specification, the JSON Web Token Proof Format of [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0](#bib-vc-data-model-2.0)] was undergoing a revision process. [[VC-JOSE-COSE](#bib-vc-jose-cose)] will collect and display
the result of this revision. The modifications resulting from the incompatibility of the revision with what is contained in this document will be added in future revisions.

#### 8.2.1 Terminology

[](#jwt-terminology)
Some of the terms used in this section include:

- JWT - "JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted." [[RFC7519](#bib-rfc7519)]

- JWS - "JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents content secured with digital signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) using JSON-based data structures. Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification and an IANA registry defined by that specification." [[RFC7515](#bib-rfc7515)]

- JWK - "A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure that represents a cryptographic key." [[RFC7517](#bib-rfc7517)]

- Compact JWS - "A compact representation of a JWS." [[RFC7515](#bib-rfc7515)]

#### 8.2.2 Overview

[](#jwt-overview)
A [JWS](#dfn-jws) is a signed [JWT](#dfn-jwt) with three parts separated by period (".") characters. Each part contains a base64url-encoded value.

- JOSE Header - Describes the cryptographic operations applied to the JWT and optionally, additional properties of the JWT. [[RFC7515](#bib-rfc7515)]

- JWT Payload - The JSON object that will be signed. In this specification, the JWT Payload includes the OpenBadgeCredential.

- JWS Signature - The computed signature of the JWT Payload.

The JOSE Header, JWT Payload, and JWS Signature are combined to form a Compact JWS. To transform a [credential](#dfn-credential) into a [Compact JWS](#dfn-compact-jws) takes 4 steps:

- Create the [JOSE Header](#dfn-jose-header), specifying the signing algorithm to use

- Create the [JWT Payload](#dfn-jwt-payload) from the [credential](#dfn-credential) to be signed

- Compute the signature of the [JWT Payload](#dfn-jwt-payload)

- Encode the resulting [JWS](#dfn-jws) as a [Compact JWS](#dfn-compact-jws)

The resulting [JWS](#dfn-jws) proves that the [issuer](#dfn-issuer) signed the [JWT Payload](#dfn-jwt-payload) turning the [credential](#dfn-credential) into a [verifiable credential](#dfn-vc).

When using the JSON Web Token Proof Format, the `proof` property MAY be omitted from the [OpenBadgeCredential](#achievementcredential). If a Linked Data Proof is also provided, it MUST be created before the JSON Web Token Proof Format is created.

#### 8.2.3 Create the JOSE Header

[](#joseheader)
The [JOSE Header](#dfn-jose-header) is a JSON object with the following properties (also called JOSE Headers). Additional JOSE Headers are NOT allowed.

Property / JOSE Header
Type
Description
Required?

`alg`
[String](#string)
The signing algorithm MUST be "RS256" as a minimum as defined in [[RFC7518](#bib-rfc7518)]. Support for other algorithms is permitted but their use limits interoperability. Later versions of this specification MAY add OPTIONAL support for other algorithms. See Section 6.1 RSA Key of the [IMS Global Security Framework v1.1](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p1/).
Required

`kid`
[URI](#uri)
A URI that can be [dereferenced](#dereference) to an object of type [JWK](#jwk) representing the public key used to verify the signature. If you do not include a `kid` property in the header, you MUST include the public key in the `jwk` property. Be careful not to accidentally expose the JWK representation of a private key. See [RFC7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#appendix-A.2) for examples of private key representations. The `JWK` MUST never contain `"d"`.
Optional

`jwk`
[JWK](#jwk)
A JWK representing the public key used to verify the signature. If you do not include a `jwk` property in the header, you MUST include the `kid` property. Be careful not to accidentally expose the JWK representation of a private key. See [RFC7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#appendix-A.2) for examples of private key representations. The `JWK` MUST never contain `"d"`.
Optional

`typ`
[String](#string)
If present, MUST be set to "JWT".
Optional

    [Example 29](#example-sample-jose-header-with-reference-to-a-public-key-in-a-jwks): Sample JOSE Header with reference to a public key in a JWKS

```
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "kid": "https://example.edu/keys#key-1",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

#### 8.2.4 Create the JWT Payload

[](#create-the-jwt-payload)

If you are going to use both external and embedded proof formats, add the embedded proofs prior to creating the JWT Payload.

##### 8.2.4.1 JWT Payload Format

[](#jwt-payload-format)

The JWT Payload is the JSON object of the [OpenBadgeCredential](#achievementcredential) with the following properties (JWT Claims). Additional standard JWT Claims Names are allowed, but their relationship to the credential is not defined.

Property / Claim Name
Type
Description
Required?

`exp`
[NumericDate](#numericdate)
The `validUntil` property of the OpenBadgeCredential. Required if the OpenBadgeCredential has an `validUntil`.
Optional

`iss`
[URI](#uri)
The `issuer.id` property of the OpenBadgeCredential.
Required

`jti`
[URI](#uri)
The `id` property of the OpenBadgeCredential.
Required

`nbf`
[NumericDate](#numericdate)
The `validFrom` property of the OpenBadgeCredential.
Required

`sub`
[URI](#uri)
The `credentialSubject.id` property of the OpenBadgeCredential.
Required

#### 8.2.5 Create the Proof

[](#jwt-signing)Note: Sign and Encode the JWS

1EdTech strongly recommends using an existing, stable library for this step.

This section uses the follow notations:

- `JOSE Header` - denotes the JSON string representation of the JOSE Header.

- `JWT Payload` - denotes the JSON string representation of the JWT Payload.

- `BASE64URL(OCTETS)` - denotes the base64url encoding of OCTETS per [[RFC7515](#bib-rfc7515)].

- `UTF8(STRING)` - denotes the octets of the UTF-8 [[RFC3629](#bib-rfc3629)] representation of STRING, where STRING is a sequence of Unicode [[UNICODE](#bib-unicode)] characters.

- The concatenation of two values A and B is denoted as `A || B`.

The steps to sign and encode the credential as a Compact JWS are shown below:

- Encode the JOSE Header as `BASE64URL(UTF8(JOSE Header))`.

- Encode the JWT Payload as `BASE64URL(JWT Payload)`.

- Concatenate the encoded JOSE Header and the encoded JSW Payload as `A | "." | B`.

- Calculate the `JWS Signature` for `C` as described in [[RFC7515](#bib-rfc7515)].

- Encode the signature as `BASE64URL(JWS Signature)`.

- Concatenate `C` and `E` as `C | "." | E`.

The resulting string is the Compact JWS representation of the credential. The Compact JWS includes the credential AND acts as the proof for the credential.

#### 8.2.6 Verify a Credential

[](#jwt-verify)
Verifiers that receive a OpenBadgeCredential in Compact JWS format MUST perform the following steps to verify the embedded credential.

Base64url-decode the JOSE Header.

If the header includes a `kid` property, [Dereference](#dereference) the `kid` value to retrieve the public key [JWK](#jwk).

If the header includes a `jwk` property, convert the `jwk` value into the public key [JWK](#jwk).

Use the public key JWK to verify the signature as described in "Section 5.2 Message Signature or MAC Validation" of [[RFC7515](#bib-rfc7515)]. If the signature is not valid, the credential proof is not valid.

Note: Verifying the JWS Signature

1EdTech strongly recommends using an existing, stable library for this step.

Base64url-decode the JWT Payload segment of the Compact JWS and parse it into a JSON object.

Convert the value of the JWT Payload to an [OpenBadgeCredential](#achievementcredential) and continue with [§ 8.2.6.1 Verify a Credential VC-JWT Signature](#jwt-verify-credential).

Note
Credentials created following [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) ([[VC-DATA-MODEL](#bib-vc-data-model)]) store the [OpenBadgeCredential](#achievementcredential) in the `vc` claim of the JWT Payload. In this case, the
contents of the `vc` claim must be converted to an [OpenBadgeCredential](#achievementcredential)
and continue with [§ 8.2.6.1 Verify a Credential VC-JWT Signature](#jwt-verify-credential).

##### 8.2.6.1 Verify a Credential VC-JWT Signature

[](#jwt-verify-credential)

- The JSON object MUST have the `iss` claim, and the value MUST match the `issuer.id` of the [OpenBadgeCredential](#achievementcredential) object. If they do not match, the credential is not valid.

- The JSON object MUST have the `sub` claim, and the value MUST match the `credentialSubject.id` of the [OpenBadgeCredential](#achievementcredential) object. If they do not match, the credential is not valid.

- The JSON object MUST have the `nbf` claim, and the [NumericDate](#numericdate) value MUST be converted to a [DateTime](#datetime), and MUST equal the `validFrom` of the [OpenBadgeCredential](#achievementcredential) object. If they do not match or if the `validFrom` has not yet occurred, the credential is not valid.

- The JSON object MUST have the `jti` claim, and the value MUST match the `id` of the [OpenBadgeCredential](#achievementcredential) object. If they do not match, the credential is not valid.

- If the JSON object has the `exp` claim, the [NumericDate](#numericdate) MUST be converted to a [DateTime](#datetime), and MUST be used to set the value of the `validUntil` of the [OpenBadgeCredential](#achievementcredential) object. If the credential has expired, the credential is not valid.

Note
Credentials created following [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) ([[VC-DATA-MODEL](#bib-vc-data-model)]) have different names for attributes used in this process. Concretely, they have `issuanceDate` and `expirationDate` instead of `validFrom` and `validUntil`, respectively

### 8.3 Linked Data Proof Format

[](#lds-proof)
This standard supports the Linked Data Proof format. In order to pass conformance tests for this format issuers MUST use an option supported by the 1EdTech conformance test suite, which is currently limited to the [Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-eddsa/) suite.

Note
Whenever possible, you should use a library or service to create and verify a Linked Data Proof.

#### 8.3.1 Create the Proof

[](#create-the-proof)

Attach a Linked Data Proof to the credential, for example by following these steps to use a proof with the [[VC-DI-EDDSA](#bib-vc-di-eddsa)] suite:

- Create an instance of [Multikey](#multikey) as shown in [Section 2.1.1 DataIntegrityProof](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-eddsa/#multikey) of [[VC-DI-EDDSA](#bib-vc-di-eddsa)].

- Using the key material, sign the credential object as shown in [Section 7.1 Proof Algorithm](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/data-integrity-spec/#proof-algorithm) of [[DATA-INTEGRITY-SPEC](#bib-data-integrity-spec)] to produce a [Proof](#proof) as shown in [Section 2.2.1 DataIntegrityProof](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-eddsa/#dataintegrityproof) of [[VC-DI-EDDSA](#bib-vc-di-eddsa)] with a `proofPurpose` of "assertionMethod".

- Add the resulting proof object to the credential `proof` property.

#### 8.3.2 Verify an OpenBadgeCredential Linked Data Signature

[](#lds-verify)
Verify the Linked Data Proof signature as shown in [Section 7.2 Proof Verification Algorithm](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/data-integrity-spec/#proof-verification-algorithm) of [[DATA-INTEGRITY-SPEC](#bib-data-integrity-spec)].

### 8.4 Key Management

[](#key-management)

[Issuers](#dfn-issuer) will need to manage asymmetric keys. The mechanisms by which keys are minted and distributed is outside the scope of this specification. See Section 6. Key Management of the [IMS Global Security Framework v1.1](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/security/v1p1/).

### 8.5 Dereferencing the Public Key

[](#dereference)
All the proof formats in this specification, and all Digital Integrity proofs in general, require the [verifier](#dfn-verifier) to "dereference" the public key from a URI. Dereferencing means using the URI to get the public key in [JWK](#jwk) format. This specification allows the use of an HTTP URL (e.g. `https://1edtech.org/keys/1`) or a DID URL (e.g. `did:key:123`), but only requires HTTP URL support.

## 9. Verification and Validation

[](#verification-and-validation)

[Verification](#dfn-verifiable) is the process to determine whether a [verifiable credential](#dfn-vc) or [verifiable presentation](#dfn-vp) is an authentic and timely statement of the issuer or presenter respectively. This includes checking that: the credential (or presentation) conforms to the specification; the proof method is satisfied; and, if present, the status check succeeds. Verification of a credential does not imply evaluation of the truth of claims encoded in the credential.

[Validation](#dfn-validation) is the process of assuring the verifiable credential or verifiable presentation meets the needs of the verifier and other dependent stakeholders. Validating verifiable credentials or verifiable presentations is outside the scope of this specification.

Note
The 1EdTech Validator performs [verification](#dfn-verifiable) as described here.

### 9.1 OpenBadgeCredential Verification

[](#verification)
This section applies to Verifiable Credentials with a `type` of "OpenBadgeCredential" or "AchievementCredential".

Check that the OpenBadgeCredential conforms to the specification:

- If the OpenBadgeCredential has a `credentialSchema` property, and the `type` of the [CredentialSchema](#credentialschema) object is "1EdTechJsonSchemaValidator2019", check that the credential conforms to JSON Schema as shown in [1EdTech JSON Schema Validator 2019](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/vccs/v1p0/). If it does not, the credential does not conform to the specification.

- Check that the `credentialSubject` is identified by an `id` and/or an `identifier`. If neither is present, the credential does not conform to the specification.

Note
OpenBadgeCredentials created following [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) ([[VC-DATA-MODEL](#bib-vc-data-model)]) have different names for attributes used in this process. Concretely, they have `issuanceDate` and `expirationDate` instead of `validFrom` and `validUntil`, respectively.
The data model of these credentials and their corresponding JSON schemas,
are described at [§ B.9 Verification Support Data Models](#org-1edtech-ob-v3p0-model-6) and
[§ E.2.1 Open Badges JSON Schema](#org-1edtech-ob-v3p0-model-9), respectively.

Check that the proof method is satisfied:

- If the OpenBadgeCredential is signed using the [§ 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format](#jwt-proof) (VC-JWT), verify the signature as shown in [§ 8.2.6 Verify a Credential](#jwt-verify). If the OpenBadgeCredential is signed using an embedded proof, verify the signature as shown in [§ 8.3.2 Verify an OpenBadgeCredential Linked Data Signature](#lds-verify). If the signature cannot be verified, the proof method is not satisfied.

Note
The OpenBadgeCredential may have a VC-JWT proof and one or more Linked Data proofs. In this case, the Linked Data proofs will be attached to the OpenBadgeCredential in the signed JWT Payload. You may accept any one proof for verification. You do not need to verify all the signatures.

Refresh the OpenBadgeCredential:

Note
Refresh must be completed after checking the proof so that the verifier is not spoofed into receiving a refreshed OpenBadgeCredential from a bad actor.

If the `refreshService` property is present, and the `type` of the [RefreshService](#refreshservice) object is "1EdTechCredentialRefresh", refresh the OpenBadgeCredential as shown in [1EdTech Credential Refresh Service](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/vccr/v1p0/) and then repeat steps 1 and 2. If the refresh is not successful, continue the verification process using the original OpenBadgeCredential.Note
Only perform Refresh once. That is, do not complete Refresh a second time even if the refreshed OpenBadgeCredential also has a `refreshService` defined.

Check the status:

- A Credential is revoked if the `credentialStatus` property is present, and the `type` of the [CredentialStatus](#credentialstatus) object is "BitstringStatusListEntry", and if the Credential has been revoked as shown in [Bitstring Status List v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/).

- If the current date and time is before the `validFrom`, the OpenBadgeCredential is not yet valid.

- If the current date and time is after the `validUntil`, the OpenBadgeCredential is expired.

Note
OpenBadgeCredentials created following [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) ([[VC-DATA-MODEL](#bib-vc-data-model)]) have different names for attributes used in this process. Concretely, they have `issuanceDate` and `expirationDate` instead of `validFrom` and `validUntil`, respectively.
The data model of these credentials and their corresponding JSON schemas,
are described at [§ B.9 Verification Support Data Models](#org-1edtech-ob-v3p0-model-6) and
[§ E.2.1 Open Badges JSON Schema](#org-1edtech-ob-v3p0-model-9), respectively.

Optionally verify the subject (recipient):

Note
This step is optional, but RECOMMENDED when the OpenBadgeCredential has been exchanged with the verifier as one of the [§ 5. Open Badges Document Formats](#docformat).

- An OpenBadgeCredential is about a person called the recipient. The recipient is identified in the `credentialSubject` (see [AchievementSubject](#achievementsubject)) by `id` and/or one or more `identifier` (see [IdentityObject](#identityobject)). The id or identifier value to use for verification must be shared with the verifier in an out-of-band process such as by email. This is called the known value.

- To verify the recipient using a known id, simply compare the known value with the `id` in the ClrSubject. If they are equal then the recipient is verified.

- To verify the recipient using a known identifier such as email address follow these steps shown in [§ 9.3 Verify the Recipient Using an Identifier](#verify-identifier). If you find a match then the recipient is verified.

- If no match is found, the recipient is not verified.

Verify EndorsementCredentials:

- If the OpenBadgeCredential contains any EndorsementCredentials, verify the EndorsementCredentials as shown in [§ 9.2 EndorsementCredential Verification](#endorsement-verification).

If all the above steps pass, the OpenBadgeCredential may be treated as verified.

### 9.2 EndorsementCredential Verification

[](#endorsement-verification)
This section applies to Verifiable Credentials with a `type` of "EndorsementCredential".

Check that the EndorsementCredential conforms to the specification:

- If the credential has a `credentialSchema` property, and the `type` of the [CredentialSchema](#credentialschema) object is "1EdTechJsonSchemaValidator2019", check that the credential conforms to JSON Schema as shown in [1EdTech JSON Schema Validator 2019](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/vccs/v1p0/). If it does not, the credential does not conform to the specification.

Note
EndorsementCredentials created following [[VC-DATA-MODEL](#bib-vc-data-model)] have different names for attributes used in this process. Concretely, they have `issuanceDate` and `expirationDate` instead of `validFrom` and `validUntil`, respectively.
The data model of these credentials and their corresponding JSON schemas,
are described at [§ B.9 Verification Support Data Models](#org-1edtech-ob-v3p0-model-6) and
[§ E.2.1 Open Badges JSON Schema](#org-1edtech-ob-v3p0-model-9), respectively.

Check that the proof method is satisfied:

If the EndorsementCredential is signed using the [§ 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format](#jwt-proof) (VC-JWT), verify the signature as shown in [§ 8.2.6 Verify a Credential](#jwt-verify). If the EndorsementCredential is signed using an embedded proof, verify the signature as shown in [§ 8.3.2 Verify an OpenBadgeCredential Linked Data Signature](#lds-verify). If the signature cannot be verified, the proof method is not satisfied.Note
The EndorsementCredential may have a VC-JWT proof and one or more Linked Data proofs. In this case, the Linked Data proofs will be attached to the EndorsementCredential in the appropriate claim of the signed JWT Payload. You may accept any one proof for verification. You do not need to verify all the signatures.

Refresh the EndorsementCredential:

If the `refreshService` property is present, and the `type` of the [RefreshService](#refreshservice) object is "1EdTechCredentialRefresh", refresh the EndorsementCredential as shown in [1EdTech Credential Refresh Service](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/vccr/v1p0/) and then repeat steps 1 and 2. If the refresh is not successful, continue the verification process using the original EndorsementCredential.Note
Refresh must be completed after checking the proof so that the verifier is not spoofed into receiving a refreshed EndorsementCredential from a bad actor.

Note
Only perform Refresh once. That is, do not complete Refresh a second time even if the refreshed EndorsementCredential also has a `refreshService` defined.

Check the status:

- If the `credentialStatus` property is present, and the `type` of the [CredentialStatus](#credentialstatus) object is "BitstringStatusListEntry", and determine if the EndorsementCredential has been revoked as shown in [Bitstring Status List v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/).

- If the current date and time is before the `validFrom`, the EndorsementCredential is not yet valid.

- If the current date and time is after the `validUntil`, the EndorsementCredential is expired.

Note
EndorsementCredentials created following [[VC-DATA-MODEL](#bib-vc-data-model)] have different names for attributes used in this process. Concretely, they have `issuanceDate` and `expirationDate` instead of `validFrom` and `validUntil`, respectively.
The data model of these credentials and their corresponding JSON schemas,
are described at [§ B.9 Verification Support Data Models](#org-1edtech-ob-v3p0-model-6) and
[§ E.2.1 Open Badges JSON Schema](#org-1edtech-ob-v3p0-model-9), respectively.

If all the above steps pass, the EndorsementCredential may be treated as verified.

### 9.3 Verify the Recipient Using an Identifier

[](#verify-identifier)
The known identifier MUST be a plaintext string value. The known identifier type MUST be one of the types in [IdentifierTypeEnum](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.identifiertypeenum.class) or an extension type. For example, if the known identifier is an email address, the known identifier type is `emailAddress`.

The ClrCredential issuer may include multiple identifiers that can be used for verification. The verifier should compare the known identifier (e.g. known email address) with all the identifiers included by the issuer until a match is found.

- If `identifier.identityType` does not match the known identifier type, skip to the next `identifier`.

- If `identifier.hashed` is `true`, calculate the known identifier [IdentityHash](#identityhash) using the known identifier and the `identifier.salt`. If the known identifier IdentityHash matches the `identifier.identityHash`, the recipient is verified.

- If `identifier.hashed` is `false`, and if the known identifier matches the `identifier.identityHash`, the recipient is verified.

## 10. Credential equality and comparison algorithm

[](#credential-equality-and-comparison-algorithm)

Credential equality and comparison is the process to determine whether a [verifiable credential](#dfn-vc) is semantically equivalent to another one.

A Host SHOULD treat a credential as the same as another when both the [issuer](#profile) `id` and the [AchievementCredential](#achievementcredential) `id` are equal after unescaping of any percent encoded characters [[RFC3986](#bib-rfc3986)] followed by truncation of leading and trailing whitespace.

If the two credentials are equal according to the above, then the credential with the newer `validFrom` is the more up-to-date representation and could be interpreted as a replacement of the prior issued credential.

### 10.1 Examples

The credential C is the up-to-date representation because it has a more recent `validFrom` (`2010-03-01T00:00:00Z`).

## 11. Verifiable Credentials Extensions

[](#vc-extensions)

    The [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) standard defines several types of extensions to enable "permissionless innovation".
    Conformant extensions are tracked in the [Verifiable Credentials Extension Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-extension-registry/).


    This standard references four VC Extensions:



    - A Proof Method called `DataIntegrityProof` defined at [Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites v1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-di-eddsa/)

    - A Refresh Method called [1EdTech Credential Refresh Service](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/vccr/v1p0/)

    - A Data Schema Validation Method called [1EdTech JSON Schema Validator 2019](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/vccs/v1p0/)

Note
The 1EdTech extensions are designed to work with any [verifiable credential](#dfn-vc) and may be contributed to the
[[VC-EXTENSION-REGISTRY](#bib-vc-extension-registry)] in the future.

## A. Serialization

[](#serialization-0)

The data model as described in Appendix [§ B. Data Models](#datamodels) is the canonical structural representation of an Open Badges [verifiable credential](#dfn-vc) ([AchievementCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.achievementcredential.class)). All serializations are representations of that data model in a specific format. This section specifies how the data model is realized in JSON-LD and plain JSON.

### A.1 JSON

[](#json)

The data model can be encoded in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) [[RFC8259](#bib-rfc8259)] by mapping property types in the Data Model to JSON types as follows:

- Numeric values representable as [[IEEE-754](#bib-ieee-754)] MUST be represented as a JSON Number.

- Boolean values MUST be represented as a JSON Boolean.

- Sequence values MUST be represented as an JSON Array, NOT as a single value.

- Unordered sets (i.e. `0.._` and `1.._` multiplicities) of values MUST be represented as an JSON Array, NOT as a single value.

- Complex types (i.e. not primitive types or derived types) MUST be represented as an JSON Object, NOT as a URI.

- Other values MUST be represented as a JSON String.

- Null values and empty arrays MUST be ommitted from the serialized JSON. This includes empty Arrays.

### A.2 JSON-LD

[](#json-ld)

[[JSON-LD](#bib-json-ld)] is a JSON-based format used to serialize Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems already using JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to [[JSON-LD](#bib-json-ld)]. It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines.

Instances of the data model are encoded in [[JSON-LD](#bib-json-ld)] in the same way they are encoded in JSON (Section [§ A.1 JSON](#json)), with the addition of the `@context` property. The JSON-LD context is described in detail in the [[JSON-LD](#bib-json-ld)] specification and its use is elaborated on in Section [§ C. Extending and Profiling the Standard](#extending).

Multiple contexts MAY be used or combined to express any arbitrary information about verifiable credentials in idiomatic JSON. The JSON-LD context for all [verifiable credentials](#dfn-vc), available at `https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2`, is a static document that is never updated and can therefore be downloaded and cached client side. The associated vocabulary document for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model is available at `https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials`. The JSON-LD context for Open Badges [verifiable credentials](#dfn-vc) is available at `https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/context-3.0.3.json`. The associated vocabulary document for the Open Badges Data Model is available at `https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/vc/ob/vocab.html`. Open Badges [verifiable credentials](#dfn-vc) MUST be serialized with both JSON-LD contexts.

Note
Though this specification requires that a `@context` property be present, it is not required that the value of the `@context` property be processed using JSON-LD. This is to support processing using plain JSON libraries, such as those that might be used when the verifiable credential is encoded as a JWT. All libraries or processors MUST ensure that the order of the values in the `@context` property is what is expected for the specific application. Libraries or processors that support JSON-LD can process the `@context` property using full JSON-LD processing as expected.

    [Example 34](#example-json-ld-context-serialization): JSON-LD @context serialization

```
"@context": [
  "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
   "https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/context-3.0.3.json"
]
```

#### A.2.1 Compacted document form

[](#compacted-document-form)

[[JSON-LD11-API](#bib-json-ld11-api)] defines a compaction process for [[JSON-LD11](#bib-json-ld11)] documents, applying a context to shorten several fields of the document. The purpose of compaction is making the document to be represented in a form that is tailored to the use of the JSON-LD document directly as JSON.

One of the transformations made by this compaction process is representing properties with only one value as string or maps, while properties with multiple values are represented as an array of strings or maps.

The JSON-LD binding for Open Badges [verifiable credentials](#dfn-vc) MAY use singular values compaction in some attributes in the data model, such they can be expressed as a string – when having only one value – or an array of strings – when having multiple values.

The properties that may be compacted are listed in the following table:

Class

[AchievementCredential](#achievementcredential)
`credentialSchema`

[AchievementCredential](#achievementcredential)

            Term
            Description




    invalid_request

      The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed.




    unauthorized_client

      The client is not authorized to request an authorization code using this method.




    access_denied

      The resource owner or authorization server denied the request.




    unsupported_response_type

      The authorization server does not support obtaining an authorization code using this method.




    invalid_scope

      The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed.




    server_error

      The authorization server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. (This error code is needed because a 500 Internal Server Error HTTP status code cannot be returned to the client via an HTTP redirect.)




    temporarily_unavailable

      The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. (This error code is needed because a 503 Service Unavailable HTTP status code cannot be returned to the client via an HTTP redirect.)








#### B.5.2 RegistrationError Vocabulary

            Description




    invalid_redirect_uri

      The value of one or more redirection URIs is invalid.




    invalid_client_metadata

      The value of one of the client metadata fields is invalid and the server has rejected this request. Note that an authorization server MAY choose to substitute a valid value for any requested parameter of a client's metadata.




    invalid_software_statement

      The software statement presented is invalid. This MUST only be returned if a Software Statement has been supplied in the registration request. Use of a Software Statement is NOT RECOMMENDED.




    unapproved_software_statement

      The software statement presented is not approved for use by this authorization server. This MUST only be returned if a Software Statement has been supplied in the registration request. Use of a Software Statement is NOT RECOMMENDED.








#### B.5.3 TokenError Vocabulary

[](#tokenerror-vocabulary)
This is the set of ASCII error code strings that may be returned in response to a client token request. See Section 5.2 of [[RFC6749](#bib-rfc6749)].

    invalid_request

      The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter value (other than grant type), repeats a parameter, includes multiple credentials, utilizes more than one mechanism for authenticating the client, or is otherwise malformed.




    invalid_client

      Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method). The authorization server MAY return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code to indicate which HTTP authentication schemes are supported. If the client attempted to authenticate via the "Authorization" request header field, the authorization server MUST respond with an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code and include the "WWW-Authenticate" response header field matching the authentication scheme used by the client.




    invalid_grant

      The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization code, resource owner credentials) or refresh token is invalid, expired, revoked, does not match the redirection URI used in the authorization request, or was issued to another client.




    unauthorized_client

      The authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization grant type.




    unsupported_grant_type

      The authorization grant type is not supported by the authorization server.




    unsupported_token_type

      The authorization server does not support the revocation of the presented token type. That is, the client tried to revoke an access token on a server not supporting this feature.




    invalid_scope

      The requested scope is invalid, unknown, malformed, or exceeds the scope granted by the resource owner.

## C. Extending and Profiling the Standard

[](#extending)
This standard can be extended in three ways:

- Extend the [Data Model](#datamodels) with new classes and new properties to existing extensible classes

- Extend the Extensible Enumerated Vocabularies in the [Data Model](#datamodels)

- Extend the API with new endpoints and new responses to existing endpoints

Extensions SHOULD be presented to the Comprehensive Learner Record project group for review and socialization.

Extensions MUST NOT be required.

Extensions WILL NOT be tested during conformance testing.

This standard can also be profiled. In general, profiling is used to:

- Refine which endpoints are used and which operations are supported for each endpoint

- Refine the data models by increasing the constraints on the base definitions

### C.1 Extending the Data Model

[](#extending-the-data-model)

A data model extension may add new classes to the [Data Model](#datamodels) and/or new properties to existing extensible classes. Extensible classes are identified by the phrase, "This class can be extended with additional properties" shown at the bottom of the table of properties. For example, the [Alignment](#alignment) class is extensible.

The extension SHOULD be documented with the following artifacts:

- A description of the extension and the problem it solves. Ideally the description would include a use case formatted like the use cases in this specification.

- Definitions of the new classes being introduced. Each definition MUST include the class name, description, and properties; and indicate whether the class can be extended.

- Definitions of the new properties being introduced. The each definition MUST include the property name, type, and description; and indicate whether the property is required.

- A JSON Schema file that defines the new classes and/or properties. The JSON Schema file MUST be hosted on a publicly accessible server with no CORS restrictions.

- A JSON-LD Context file that defines the new classes and/or properties. The context file MUST be hosted on a publically accessible server with no CORS restrictions.

- Ideally a modified version of the CLR Standard OpenAPI file that includes the new classes and/or properties.

To use the extension implementers MUST do the following:

- Include the JSON-LD Context file URL in the `@context` property. See [Serialization](#serialization).

- Include the JSON Schema file URL in the `credentialSchema` property.

### C.2 Extending Enumerated Vocabularies

[](#extending-enumerated-vocabularies)

All extensible enumerated vocabularies may be extended with custom terms. Extensible vocabularies are identified by the phrase, "This enumeration can be extended with new, proprietary terms" shown at the bottom of the table of terms. For example, the [AchivementType](#achievementtype-enumeration) enumeration is extensible.

Extended terms MUST start with the prefix "ext:". For example, "ext:MyTerm".

The extended terms SHOULD be documented with the following artifacts:

- A description of the extension and the problem it solves. Ideally the description would include a use case formatted like the use cases in this specification.

- Definitions of each extended term. Each definition MUST include the extended term (e.g. "ext:MyTerm") and description.

- A JSON Schema file is not required. The existing JSON Schema for extensible vocabularies allows extended terms that follow the naming rule above.

- You MAY include a JSON-LD Context file that defines the new extended terms. If one is supplied, it MUST be hosted on a publically accessible server with no CORS restrictions.

To use the extended vocabulary implementers MAY do the following:

- Include the JSON-LD Context file URL in the `@context` property. See [Serialization](#serialization).

### C.3 Extending the API

[](#extending-the-api)

An API extension may add new endpoints (with or without new scopes) to the [CLR Standard API](#api) and/or new responses to the existing endpoints.

The extension SHOULD be documented with the following artifacts:

- A description of the extension and the problem it solves. Ideally the description would include a use case formatted like the use cases in this specification.

Definitions of the new endpoints being introduced. Each definition MUST include the endpoint name, description, HTTP Method, URL format, required request query parameters (if any), required request headers, required request payload (if any), required responses, and required response headers.

- The URL format MUST following 1EdTech naming conventions. Specifically, the path "/ims/clr/v2p0/" must precede the final URL segment. For example, "/ims/clr/v2p0/myendpoint".

- The definition must indicate if the endpoint requires authorization. If it does, the definition must define the scope that is required. New endpoints that require authorization MUST follow the requirements shown in [CLR Standard API Security](#api-security).

- Each required query parameter definition MUST include the parameter type and description.

- Each required request header definition MUST include the header and a description.

- A required request payload definition MUST include the payload type.

- Each required request response definition MUST include the HTTP Status Code, payload type (if any), and description. Non-successful responses (i.e. HTTP Status Code ]= 400) SHOULD use the [Imsx_StatusInfo](#imsx_statusinfo) payload.

- Each requied response header defintion MUST include the header and a description.

- Definitions of the new responses to existing endpoints. The each definition MUST include the HTTP Status Code, payload type (if any), and description. Non-successful responses (i.e. HTTP Status Code ]= 400) SHOULD use the [Imsx_StatusInfo](#imsx_statusinfo) payload.

- Ideally an OpenAPI file that describes the new endpoints and/or responses to existing endpoints.

### C.4 Profiles

[](#profiles)

Profiling is the process by which an 1EdTech specification is tailored to meet the requirements of a specific community: the community could be a reflection of a market sector, a geographic location, etc. An example of such a community is the Norwegian K-12/Schools for whom a profile of the 1EdTech OneRoster 1.2 specification has been created. The process of profiling starts with the corresponding base specification and defines a set of new constraints to make the subsequent modified specification better fit the requirements of the target community. Once the profile has been defined, the next step is to create the corresponding Conformance Test Systems and Certification process for that profile: these will be modified versions of the equivalents created for the base specification. It is recommended that profiling is undertaken within 1EdTech so that the 1EdTech model driven specification tools can be used.

A profile is the product produced by the process of specification Profiling. A Profile of an 1EdTech specification consists of a set of new constraints. In general an 1EdTech specification enables a wide range education and learning workflows, processes and practices. A profile is designed to establish and impose best practices for the target community. A profile MUST only increase constraints i.e. it MUST NOT relax constraints in the base specification. For example the multiplicity of a property in the data model MAY be changed from [1..] (required and permitting many) to [1..1] (required and only one) but MUST NOT become [0..] (optional and permitting many). The most common profiling changes include more strict data typing, changes to enumerations, vocabulary changes, prohibition of endpoints and creation of new endpoints. A profile could make use of the extension capabilties to extend the specification to support new features. The key objective of a rofile is to remove, wherever possible, interoperability uncertainty e.g. by removing optionality.

It is strongly recommended that a profile of this standard is undertaken either by, or with the close support, of 1EdTech. However, no matter who is responsible for creating the profile artefacts (documents, schemas, etc.), it is strongly recommended that 1EdTech specification tools are used. This will ensure that the artefacts are consistent with the base specifications and that useful support documentation is automatically produced e.g. creation of a document that summarises the differences between the base specification and the profile.

### D.6 Skill Assertion (CASE)

[](#skill-assertion-case)

Note
A Skill Assertion credential is just like a [basic OpenBadgeCredential]() in how an Achievement is included, except that it makes a claim referencing an Achievement that is generic to allow for use by many possible issuers. The Achievement here is aligned to a CASE CFItem.

    [Example 40](#example-skill-assertion-case): Skill Assertion (CASE)

- Verifiable Credential (with proof)
- Verifiable Credential (as JWT)

### D.7 Skill Assertion (Credential Engine)

[](#skill-assertion-credential-engine)

Note
A Skill Assertion credential is just like a [basic OpenBadgeCredential]() in how an Achievement is included, except that it makes a claim referencing an Achievement that is generic to allow for use by many possible issuers. The Achievement here is aligned to a Competency registered on the Credential Registry and described in CTDL.

    [Example 41](#example-skill-assertion-credential-registry): Skill Assertion (Credential Registry)



- Credential
- Verifiable Credential (with proof)
- Verifiable Credential (as JWT)

##### E.2.1.2 AchievementCredential

[](#achievementcredential-0)
AchievementCredentials are representations of an awarded achievement, used to share information about a achievement belonging to one earner. Maps to a Verifiable Credential as defined in the [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0](#bib-vc-data-model-2.0)]. As described in [§ 8. Proofs (Signatures)](#data-integrity), at least one proof mechanism, and the details necessary to evaluate that proof, MUST be expressed for a credential to be a verifiable credential. In the case of an embedded proof, the credential MUST append the proof in the `proof` property.

##### E.2.1.6 Criteria

[](#criteria-0)
Descriptive metadata about the achievements necessary to be recognized with an assertion of a particular achievement. This data is added to the Achievement class so that it may be rendered when the achievement assertion is displayed, instead of simply a link to human-readable criteria external to the achievement. Embedding criteria allows either enhancement of an external criteria page or increased portability and ease of use by allowing issuers to skip hosting the formerly-required external criteria page altogether. Criteria is used to allow would-be recipients to learn what is required of them to be recognized with an assertion of a particular achievement. It is also used after the assertion is awarded to a recipient to let those inspecting earned achievements know the general requirements that the recipients met in order to earn it.

##### E.2.1.9 Evidence

[](#evidence-0)
Descriptive metadata about evidence related to the achievement assertion. Each instance of the evidence class present in an assertion corresponds to one entity, though a single entry can describe a set of items collectively. There may be multiple evidence entries referenced from an assertion. The narrative property is also in scope of the assertion class to provide an overall description of the achievement related to the assertion in rich text. It is used here to provide a narrative of achievement of the specific entity described. If both the description and narrative properties are present, displayers can assume the narrative value goes into more detail and is not simply a recapitulation of description.

##### E.2.1.14 Profile

[](#profile-0)
A Profile is a collection of information that describes the entity or organization using Open Badges. Issuers must be represented as Profiles, and endorsers, or other entities may also be represented using this vocabulary. Each Profile that represents an Issuer may be referenced in many BadgeClasses that it has defined. Anyone can create and host an Issuer file to start issuing Open Badges. Issuers may also serve as recipients of Open Badges, often identified within an Assertion by specific properties, like their url or contact email address.

##### E.2.1.19 VerifiableCredential

[](#verifiablecredential-0)
A Verifiable Credential as defined in the [[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0](#bib-vc-data-model-2.0)]. As described in [§ 8. Proofs (Signatures)](#proofs-signatures), at least one proof mechanism, and the details necessary to evaluate that proof, MUST be expressed for a credential to be a verifiable credential. In the case of an embedded proof, the credential MUST append the proof in the `proof` property.

##### E.2.1.34 AchievementCredentialv1p1

[](#achievementcredentialv1p1-0)
AchievementCredentials are representations of an awarded achievement, used to share information about a achievement belonging to one earner. Maps to a Verifiable Credential as defined in the [[VC-DATA-MODEL](#bib-vc-data-model)]. As described in [§ 8. Proofs (Signatures)](#data-integrity), at least one proof mechanism, and the details necessary to evaluate that proof, MUST be expressed for a credential to be a verifiable credential. In the case of an embedded proof, the credential MUST append the proof in the `proof` property.

##### E.2.1.37 VerifiableCredentialv1p1

[](#verifiablecredentialv1p1-0)
A Verifiable Credential as defined in the [[VC-DATA-MODEL](#bib-vc-data-model)]. As described in [§ 8. Proofs (Signatures)](#proofs-signatures), at least one proof mechanism, and the details necessary to evaluate that proof, MUST be expressed for a credential to be a verifiable credential. In the case of an embedded proof, the credential MUST append the proof in the `proof` property.

##### E.2.1.40 Profilev1p1

[](#profilev1p1-0)
A Profile is a collection of information that describes the entity or organization using Open Badges. Issuers must be represented as Profiles, and endorsers, or other entities may also be represented using this vocabulary. Each Profile that represents an Issuer may be referenced in many BadgeClasses that it has defined. Anyone can create and host an Issuer file to start issuing Open Badges. Issuers may also serve as recipients of Open Badges, often identified within an Assertion by specific properties, like their url or contact email address.

##### E.2.1.50 ServiceDescriptionDocument

[](#servicedescriptiondocument-0)
The Service Description Document (SDD) is a machine readable document that contains the description of the service features supported by the Provider/Platform. The SDD is an OpenAPI 3.0 (JSON) [[OPENAPIS-3.0](#bib-openapis-3.0)] structured document that MUST be a profiled version of the OpenAPI 3.0 (JSON) file provided provided with this specification. This profiled version contains all of the details about the supported set of service end-points, the supported optional data fields, definitions of the proprietary data fields supplied using the permitted extension mechanisms, definitions of the available proprietary endpoints, and information about the security mechanisms.

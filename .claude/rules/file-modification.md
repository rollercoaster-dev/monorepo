# File Modification Rules

## Permission Patterns

These phrases grant file modification permission:

- "make the change", "implement this", "go ahead", "fix it", "create the file"
- "proceed" (within gated workflow)

These don't grant permission:

- "what do you think?", "how would you...", "can you show me...", "explain how to..."

# Knowledge Query Skill

Semantic search and structured queries over the knowledge graph containing learnings, patterns, and mistakes extracted from past work.

## When to Use

- Before implementing a feature (find relevant learnings)
- When encountering an unfamiliar code area (discover patterns)
- To avoid repeating past mistakes
- When researching how similar issues were solved
- To understand established patterns in a code area
- For semantic search across all stored knowledge
- To query knowledge by specific filters (code area, file, issue)

## CLI Reference

All commands use the checkpoint CLI:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge <command> [args...]
```

## Commands

### Store Learning

Manually store a learning (note: most learnings are extracted automatically via session hooks):

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge store-learning <content> [options]
```

Options:

- `--code-area <area>` - Associated code area (e.g., "authentication", "badge-verification")
- `--file <path>` - Associated file path
- `--confidence <n>` - Confidence level (1-10, default: 7)

Example:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge store-learning "Always validate badge expiration before issuing" --code-area badge-issuance --confidence 9
```

### Store Pattern

Record an established pattern:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge store-pattern <name> <description> [options]
```

Options:

- `--code-area <area>` - Code area where pattern applies

Example:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge store-pattern "credential-validation" "Use Zod schemas for all credential validation" --code-area validation
```

### Store Mistake

Record a mistake and how it was fixed:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge store-mistake <description> <how-fixed> [options]
```

Options:

- `--file <path>` - File where mistake occurred

Example:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge store-mistake "Forgot to verify signature before trusting issuer" "Added signature verification step before issuer validation" --file src/verification/verify.ts
```

### Query Knowledge

Structured query with specific filters (keyword-based):

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge query [options]
```

At least one filter required:

- `--code-area <area>` - Filter by code area
- `--file <path>` - Filter by file path
- `--text <keyword>` - Filter by keyword in content
- `--issue <n>` - Filter by source issue number
- `--limit <n>` - Max results (default: 10)

Example:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge query --code-area badge-verification
bun run checkpoint knowledge query --file src/badges/verify.ts
bun run checkpoint knowledge query --issue 380 --limit 5
bun run checkpoint knowledge query --text "signature" --code-area cryptography
```

### Semantic Search

Search using natural language with vector similarity:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge search <query-text> [options]
```

Options:

- `--limit <n>` - Max results (default: 5)
- `--threshold <n>` - Minimum similarity score 0-1 (default: 0.7)
- `--include-related` - Include related patterns and mistakes

Example:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge search "how to validate badge signatures"
bun run checkpoint knowledge search "avoiding database race conditions" --threshold 0.8
bun run checkpoint knowledge search "JWT token handling" --include-related
```

### List Code Areas

Show all code areas with stored knowledge:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge list-areas
```

Returns:

- List of code area names
- Count of learnings per area
- Recent activity

### List Files

Show all files with stored knowledge:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge list-files
```

Returns:

- List of file paths
- Count of learnings per file
- Associated code areas

### Stats

Show knowledge graph statistics:

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge stats
```

Returns:

- Total learnings
- Total patterns
- Total mistakes
- Knowledge by code area
- Knowledge by file
- Recent additions

## Example: Pre-Implementation Research

```bash
# 1. Find all knowledge about the code area
bun run checkpoint knowledge query --code-area badge-verification --limit 20

# 2. Search for similar features
bun run checkpoint knowledge search "badge signature verification"

# 3. Check for patterns in this area
bun run checkpoint knowledge list-areas

# 4. Look for mistakes to avoid
bun run checkpoint knowledge query --code-area badge-verification --text mistake
```

## Example: Semantic vs Keyword Search

**Keyword Query** (exact filter matching):

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge query --code-area authentication --text "JWT"
```

Returns only learnings that:

- Are tagged with code-area "authentication" AND
- Contain the exact text "JWT"

**Semantic Search** (natural language understanding):

```bash
bun run checkpoint knowledge search "handling authentication tokens"
```

Returns learnings similar to the query meaning, including:

- JWT handling
- Token validation
- Session management
- Auth middleware

Use semantic search for exploration, keyword query for precise filtering.

## Output Format

### Query Command

Returns JSON array of learnings:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "learning-123",
    "content": "Always validate JWT signature before trusting claims",
    "codeArea": "authentication",
    "file": "src/auth/jwt.ts",
    "confidence": 9,
    "sourceIssue": 380,
    "createdAt": "2025-01-10T14:32:00Z"
  }
]
```

### Search Command

Returns JSON array with similarity scores:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "learning-456",
    "content": "Use constant-time comparison for signature validation",
    "codeArea": "cryptography",
    "similarity": 0.89,
    "relatedPatterns": ["timing-attack-prevention"],
    "relatedMistakes": ["mistake-234"]
  }

```

- `success`: Boolean
- `id`: ID of stored entity
- `type`: "learning" | "pattern" | "mistake"

### List Commands

  "byFile": {
    "src/auth/jwt.ts": 12,
    "src/badges/verify.ts": 15
  },
  "recentCount": 8
}
```

## Integration with Session Hooks

Knowledge queries integrate with session lifecycle:

| Hook         | What It Does                                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| SessionStart | Automatically queries relevant learnings based on: |
|              | - Current issue number                             |
|              | - Code areas inferred from modified files          |
|              | - File paths being worked on                       |
| SessionEnd   | Automatically stores learnings extracted from:     |
|              | - Commit messages (conventional commits format)    |
|              | - Code areas touched during session                |
|              | - Patterns observed in implementation              |

**Note**: Automatic injection happens when hooks are wired to Claude Code (currently requires manual invocation via `checkpoint session-start`/`session-end`).

## When to Use Manual vs Automatic

**Automatic (via session hooks):**

- Knowledge injection at session start
- Learning extraction at session end
- Routine knowledge accumulation

**Manual (via this skill):**

- Mid-session research when you need more context
- Querying specific knowledge not included in auto-injection
- Storing one-off learnings or insights
- Exploring knowledge graph for patterns
- Checking what knowledge exists before writing

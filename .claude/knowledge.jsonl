On-demand querying via MCP tools is more useful.\n\n2.

Now also includes graph_queries table (MCP graph tools). Accurate ratio: 28 graph / 53 search = 0.53, not 0.\n\nArchitectural insight: MCP tool calls don't trigger PreToolUse hooks - they go directly to the MCP server.

This is a known issue (GitHub issues #15136, #17902, #19308) that Anthropic hasn't fixed. User built graph tools (graph_find, graph_what_calls, graph_blast_radius) that work well and are better for code navigation, but Claude won't use them. Metrics showed 0% graph tool usage despite explicit \"Graph First\" instructions. No amount of prompting, aggressive language, or Opus 4.5 best practices fixes this. The user has no way to actually influence tool selection behavior - the levers available (prompts, descriptions) don't control the actual decision. This is deeply frustrating for developers who can identify problems and build solutions but can't make Claude use them. Filed issues go ignored while Anthropic focuses on new models.

For example, `/** Include packages/*/docs/ (default: false) */` causes a parse error because the `*/` in the glob pattern `packages/*/docs/` is interpreted as closing the JSDoc comment block, leaving the rest as invalid syntax. This produced 17 cascading TS errors (TS1131, TS1005, TS1128, etc.) starting at the comment line. Fix: use `//` line comments instead of `/** */` JSDoc comments for inline properties in function parameter types.

Key learnings:\n\n1. LEGACY ALIASES ARE CRITICAL: Components use short-form names (--ob-gray-*, --ob-error, --ob-primary-dark) that must be aliased to new --ob-color-* foundational tokens in :root. Without these, components silently fall through to hardcoded fallbacks and theme overrides break.\n\n2. FONT IMPORT ORDER: fonts.css must be imported before tokens.css in BOTH entry points (main.css via @import and index.ts via JS import). tokens.css references --ob-font-system defined in fonts.css. Missing fonts.css from index.ts caused ND themes to silently lose accessibility fonts.\n\n3. AVOID DUPLICATE DEFINITIONS: Don't redefine font family variables in tokens.css when they already exist in fonts.css. Use aliases instead (--ob-font-sans: var(--ob-font-system)).\n\n4. THEME COMPLETENESS: Every semantic token defined in tokens.css should be overridden by every theme class. Popover, input, card tokens were missing from several themes. Use a checklist approach.\n\n5. COMPONENT TOKEN PATTERN: Every documented component should have centralized --ob-{component}-* tokens in tokens.css. Components reference these tokens instead of defining local vars with hardcoded fallbacks. This enables theme switching via the cascade.\n\n9 commits total on feat/issue-594-styling-tokens branch, PR #630.","codeArea":"openbadges-ui/styles","sourceIssue":594,"confidence":0.95},"content_hash":"a8c8e6be78a06355a18cc7c4f6e855e8f9e69a469b1f47063c3db3c29692d1cf","created_at":"2026-01-28T21:08:11.002Z","updated_at":"2026-01-28T21:08:11.002Z"}

A common pitfall, as seen with Histoire (a component playground), is that the component preview environment might not implicitly import all necessary global CSS files (like `tokens.css` or `fonts.css`). This was masked by the original hardcoded fallbacks, which provided a visual default even if the `var()` didn't resolve. Removing fallbacks exposes this underlying configuration oversight more clearly, necessitating explicit imports in environments like `histoire.setup.ts` to ensure tokens are defined. If the underlying package bundles its styles, such redundancies are unnecessary.","codeArea":"frontend/styling","confidence":0.8,"metadata":{"source":"llm-extracted","model":"google/gemini-2.5-flash","timeRange":"2026-01-29T14:20:47.666Z - 2026-01-29T16:20:47.666Z"}},"content_hash":"d0e8057aa746f2eb98f5d856fc5f6c4c2db2799dd5453cb02873e996543f886c","created_at":"2026-01-29T16:20:59.464Z","updated_at":"2026-01-29T16:20:59.464Z"}

When provided with multiple independent issue numbers, the LLM attempts to infer dependencies, which can lead to a less accurate plan. This highlights a need for explicit clarification in user commands regarding whether multiple issues constitute an epic's sub-issues or a batch of independent tasks.

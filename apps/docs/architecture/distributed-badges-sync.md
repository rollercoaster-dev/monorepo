# Sync

## Offline-First Strategies
- CRDTs vs Operational Transforms (OT)
- Local storage options: IndexedDB, SQLite, CouchDB
- Conflict resolution and eventual consistency patterns

## Replication Protocols
- AT Protocol, IPFS pub/sub, CouchDB replication
- Peer-to-peer vs hub-and-spoke topologies

## Security & Privacy
- Encrypted sync channels (Noise Protocol, TLS)
- Data partitioning per user and selective sync

## Future Exploration
- Placeholder for sync testing and benchmarking

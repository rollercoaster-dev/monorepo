Owner: Joe
Last updated: 2025-08-13

⸻

Now (0–6 weeks) — Core Foundation

Goal: Get the OpenBadges core working end-to-end for self-signed badges.
	•	Open source OpenBadges server (Bun + Hono + Drizzle)
	•	UI components (PrimeVue) for badge creation, viewing, and sharing
	•	Self-signed badges as first-class citizens
	•	Badge verification options — AI, peer review, mentor review (stub for now)
	•	Evidence submission (basic file upload)
	•	Badge portability/export (Open Badges 2.0/3.0 formats)
	•	Publish open-source packages:
	•	openbadges-system (server)
	•	openbadges-ui (components)
	•	openbadges-types (types package)

⸻

Next (6–12 weeks) — SkillTree & Federation Foundations

Goal: Create the personal badge backpack and connect federated flows.
	•	SkillTree UI — visual map of earned and available badges
	•	Badge Backpack — private, user-controlled badge storage
	•	Import/export badges from other platforms
	•	Unlockable paths — certain badges unlock new badges or mentorship roles
	•	Basic federated badge issuance — other servers can issue to your backpack
	•	Local-first mode — data stored locally, sync optional

⸻

Later (12+ weeks) — Data Economy & Advanced UX

Goal: Make the platform valuable to creators, mentors, and organizations while protecting user control.
	•	Selective sharing & encrypted storage — granular data privacy controls
	•	Data consent ledger — record of all sharing events
	•	Opt-in data marketplace — anonymized skill data, 80/20 revenue split in favor of user
	•	Targeted skill cohorts — orgs sponsor badges for desired skills
	•	Creator monetization for badge designers & mentors
	•	AI-assisted badge creation (draft metadata, visuals, descriptions)
	•	AI evidence review helper for mentors
	•	Open Badges education hub — teach the standard through the product

⸻

Principles
	•	Neurodivergent-first UX — reduce cognitive load, visual navigation, focus modes
	•	Open source at the core — interoperability > lock-in
	•	Users own their data — privacy-first, consent-driven sharing

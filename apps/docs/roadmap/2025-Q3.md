# Roadmap — 2025 Q3

**Theme:** Prove user value with the smallest end-to-end path.

**Success Criteria:** A working demo where someone can create, verify, and share a self-signed badge using Open Badges 3.0, demonstrating the core value proposition of user-owned credentials.

## Key Outcomes

**Primary Goal: End-to-End Self-Signed Badge Flow**
- User can create a self-signed badge with evidence
- Badge is stored locally using Open Badges 3.0 (VC + DID) format
- Badge can be verified through AI, peer, or mentor review
- Badge can be exported and shared outside the system
- Public demo showcases the complete workflow

**Secondary Goal: Foundation for Federation**
- Technical architecture supports future multi-node federation
- DID-based identity system is operational
- Badge format is interoperable with other OB 3.0 systems

## Detailed Work Items

### Week 1-2: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] **Set up Bun/Hono/Drizzle server** — [ADR-0003](../decisions/ADR-0003-federation-core-architecture.md)
  - Basic API endpoints for badge CRUD operations
  - Local SQLite database with Drizzle ORM
  - DID generation and management
- [ ] **Implement Open Badges 3.0 data model** — [ADR-0001](../decisions/ADR-0001-self-signed-badges.md)
  - Verifiable Credentials structure
  - Self-signed badge schema
  - Evidence attachment support

### Week 3-4: Badge Creation UI
- [ ] **PrimeVue badge creation form** — neurodivergent-first design
  - Clear, step-by-step badge creation wizard (supports Lina's quiet victory story)
  - Evidence upload (images, documents, links) — see Malik's 3D modeling story
  - Preview and validation before saving
- [ ] **Local storage implementation** — [ADR-0002](../decisions/ADR-0002-local-first-optional-sync.md)
  - Browser-based badge storage
  - Export functionality (JSON, PDF)
  - Import from other OB 2.0/3.0 systems

### Week 5-6: Verification System
- [ ] **Evidence review workflows**
  - AI-powered evidence analysis (basic)
  - Peer review invitation system
  - Mentor verification process
- [ ] **Badge validation and signing**
  - Cryptographic signing with DIDs
  - Verification status tracking
  - Trust score calculation

### Week 7-8: Showcase & Sharing
- [ ] **Badge portfolio/wallet UI**
  - Grid view of earned badges
  - Individual badge detail pages
  - Filtering and search capabilities
- [ ] **Public sharing features**
  - Shareable badge URLs
  - Social media integration
  - Embeddable badge widgets

### Week 9-10: Demo & Documentation
- [ ] **Public demo preparation**
  - End-to-end user journey documentation
  - Video walkthrough creation
  - Public instance deployment
- [ ] **Technical documentation** — link to [architecture overview](../architecture/overview.md)
  - API documentation
  - Integration guides
  - Self-hosting instructions

### Week 11-12: Polish & Launch
- [ ] **User testing and feedback integration**
  - 5+ external user tests
  - Accessibility audit and fixes
  - Performance optimization
- [ ] **Public launch**
  - Blog post and demo video
  - Community outreach
  - Feedback collection system

## Technical Decisions Required

**Immediate (Week 1-2):**
- [ ] DID method selection (did:key vs did:web vs did:ion)
- [ ] Evidence storage strategy (local files vs embedded data)
- [ ] Cryptographic signing library choice

**Medium-term (Week 5-6):**
- [ ] AI verification service integration
- [ ] Peer review notification system design
- [ ] Trust scoring algorithm definition

## Success Metrics

**Functional Metrics:**
- [ ] 100% of self-signed badges can be created, stored, and exported
- [ ] 90%+ of evidence attachments successfully processed
- [ ] <2 second badge creation time (local operations)
- [ ] Zero data loss in local storage operations

**User Experience Metrics:**
- [ ] 5+ external users complete full badge creation flow
- [ ] 80%+ user satisfaction score on creation experience
- [ ] <5 clicks to create a basic badge
- [ ] Accessibility score of AA or higher

**Technical Metrics:**
- [ ] 100% Open Badges 3.0 compliance validation
- [ ] Successful import/export with other OB 3.0 systems
- [ ] <100ms API response times for badge operations
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design on all major devices

## Risks & Mitigations

**Technical Risks:**
- *Open Badges 3.0 spec complexity* → Start with minimal compliant implementation
- *DID integration challenges* → Use well-tested libraries, fallback to simpler methods
- *Local storage limitations* → Implement export early, plan cloud backup

**User Experience Risks:**
- *Badge creation too complex* → Extensive user testing, progressive disclosure
- *Verification process unclear* → Clear status indicators, help documentation
- *Value proposition not obvious* → Focus on concrete use cases, demo scenarios

**Timeline Risks:**
- *Scope creep* → Strict feature freeze after Week 8
- *Technical blockers* → Weekly risk assessment, backup plans
- *Resource constraints* → Focus on MVP, defer nice-to-have features

# Distributed Badges Concept

## Overview

- This project is a distributed, local-first Open Badges application designed for neurodivergent users.
- High-level goals and description.

## Core Goals

- Users create and track personal or verifiable badges for any goal.
- The app runs offline-first on personal devices or Raspberry Pis, with optional syncing.
- Full user data ownership and privacy; design for safety and encryption.
- Accessible, deeply configurable interface with support for neurodivergent profiles.
- A VS Code-style interface for working on badges and building skill trees.
- Gamified and optionally social, with roles for mentors, peers, and teachers.

## Project Structure

# Vision — Now / Next / Later

**Owner:** Joe
**Last updated:** 2025-08-13

## Now (0–6 weeks)

**Core Self-Signed Badge System**
- Implement Open Badges 3.0 (VC + DID) for self-signed badges
- Build minimal badge issuance UI (create, edit, evidence upload)
- Create basic badge verification flows (AI/peer/mentor review)
- Develop local-first badge storage with export capabilities
- Design neurodivergent-friendly UX patterns and accessibility features

**Technical Foundation**
- Set up Bun/Hono/Drizzle server architecture
- Implement PrimeVue UI components for badge management
- Create basic wallet/backpack for badge storage and display
- Build evidence attachment and review system
- Establish local data persistence with optional sync

## Next (6–12 weeks)

**Federation & Multi-Node Support**
- Design federation protocol for badge exchange between nodes
- Implement DID-based trust and provenance mechanisms
- Create discovery patterns for federated badge networks
- Build cross-node badge verification and validation
- Develop reputation and trust scoring systems

**Enhanced User Experience**
- Advanced badge portfolio and showcase features
- Collaborative badge creation and peer validation workflows
- Integration with external learning platforms and systems
- Mobile-responsive design and progressive web app features
- Community features for badge sharing and discussion

**Data Marketplace Foundation**
- Design consent-based data sharing mechanisms
- Create privacy-preserving credential exchange protocols
- Build user-controlled data export and portability features
- Implement granular permission and sharing controls

## Later (12+ weeks)

**Full Ecosystem & Marketplace**
- Complete data marketplace with credential monetization
- Advanced AI-powered skill assessment and badge recommendations
- Integration with traditional credentialing systems (universities, employers)
- White-label solutions for organizations and communities
- Advanced analytics and learning pathway recommendations

**Platform Maturity**
- Multi-language support and internationalization
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance features
- Advanced federation with major badge networks
- API ecosystem for third-party integrations
- Self-hosted deployment options for organizations

## Principles

**Neurodivergent-First UX**
- Clear, predictable navigation patterns
- Reduced cognitive load with progressive disclosure
- Multiple input methods and accessibility options
- Customizable interface density and information display
- Support for different learning and processing styles

**Local-First Data Ownership**
- Users retain full control over their badge data
- Local storage as primary, cloud as optional backup
- Transparent data usage and sharing policies
- Easy export and migration capabilities
- No vendor lock-in or data hostage situations

**Open Standards & Interoperability**
- Open Badges 3.0 compliance for maximum compatibility
- W3C Verifiable Credentials for trust and verification
- DID-based identity for decentralized authentication
- Open source core components where possible
- Standards-based federation protocols

## Bets (Hypotheses)

**Self-Signed Badges Will Drive Adoption**
- Neurodivergent users and independent learners need credential ownership
- Traditional institutions move too slowly for emerging skills
- Peer validation can be as valuable as institutional validation
- Users will pay for tools that give them data ownership

**Federation Enables Network Effects**
- Multiple badge networks will emerge and need interoperability
- Trust can be established through cryptographic proofs and reputation
- Decentralized networks will outcompete centralized platforms
- Organizations will prefer federated over siloed solutions

**Local-First Solves Real Problems**
- Users are tired of losing data when services shut down
- Privacy concerns will drive demand for local-first solutions
- Offline-capable tools provide better user experience
- Data portability will become a competitive advantage

**Neurodivergent-First Design Benefits Everyone**
- Accessible design patterns improve usability for all users
- Clear information architecture reduces cognitive load universally
- Customizable interfaces serve diverse user needs
- Inclusive design drives innovation and market differentiation

# User Testing Prep — iOS First, Android Soon

**Created:** 2026-05-02
**Owner:** Joe
**Goal:** Get native-rd into the hands of real testers (iOS TestFlight first, Google Play closed test soon after) without compromising the "no data collected" privacy promise.

---

## The Single Next Thing

> **Phase 3 — Sitting A: lock the bundle ID, slug, display name, and feedback email.**
> Pure decisions, no tooling. When done, move to Sitting B (EAS Build).

---

## Bug Reporting Strategy

**Closed beta uses platform built-ins. No third-party crash reporting, no in-app code, no privacy-policy compromise.**

| Channel         | Tool                                                                                                                                                                                            | Privacy posture                                                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| iOS testers     | TestFlight 3-finger screenshot feedback + automatic crash reports → App Store Connect                                                                                                           | Apple collects under their privacy terms; testers accepted these when joining TestFlight       |
| Android testers | Play Console built-in tester feedback + automatic crash reports                                                                                                                                 | Google collects under their privacy terms; testers accepted these when joining the closed test |
| Privacy policy  | "We collect no data ourselves. If you install via TestFlight or Google Play, those platforms collect crash reports under their own privacy policies, which you accepted when joining the test." | Honest and accurate                                                                            |

**What we explicitly chose not to do:**

- **No Sentry** — its core function is data collection, incompatible with the "What Data We Collect — None" promise in `docs/launch/privacy-policy.md`
- **No in-app bug-report button** — TestFlight's screenshot feedback covers iOS; Play Console covers Android. Adding our own button is unnecessary code and unnecessary privacy surface.

This stance can be revisited if/when scaling past closed beta requires more telemetry. Closed beta does not.

## Status Snapshot

**Readiness review, 2026-05-02:** not ready to invite testers yet. The main blocker is build/distribution prep: EAS is not initialised, no standalone TestFlight build exists, and no physical-device validation has been completed. Local code health is acceptable for closed-beta prep (`type-check`, Jest, lint with warnings only, and a11y audit passed), but the installed simulator build used for E2E review was a dev build without an embedded JS bundle, so Maestro failed at launch with "No script URL provided." Treat E2E as unverified until a production-like build is installed.

The only non-build app-behavior blocker found in this review is badge creation when signing key setup fails: `useUserKey` can surface SecureStore/key-generation errors while `useCreateBadge` remains in transient loading. Track in [#982](https://github.com/rollercoaster-dev/monorepo/issues/982).

## Phases

Each phase has **one clear deliverable**. Supporting prep (privacy policy, quality refresh) can run in parallel as long as it doesn't complete a later phase's deliverable.

### Phase 0 — Apple Developer Program ✅ DONE

- [x] Enrolment approved

### Phase 3 — TestFlight build pipeline

Three focused sittings. See `docs/plans/2026-04-28-ios-testflight-readiness.md` for granular Apple admin steps.

> **Note on phase numbering:** Phases 1 and 2 (Sentry + in-app bug button) were dropped on 2026-05-02 in favour of platform built-ins; their numbers are intentionally skipped to preserve the existing issue references (#973–#978).

#### Sitting A — Decisions only (no tooling)

- [ ] Confirm iOS bundle ID: `com.joe.rd.native-rd` (yes/no)
- [x] Confirm Expo slug: `rollercoasterdev` — set during `eas init` 2026-05-02 (project ID `d7a5b9b4-48b0-460b-ab51-912e11cebd10`, owner `rollercoasterdev`)
- [ ] Confirm App Store display name spelling/capitalisation
- [ ] Choose feedback contact email (used in TestFlight metadata + privacy policy)
- [ ] Decide build/version strategy (semver? buildNumber autoincrement?)

#### Sitting B — EAS Build

- [ ] `eas login`
- [ ] `eas init`
- [ ] Add `eas.json` with development + production profiles
- [ ] Let EAS manage iOS signing credentials
- [ ] Produce first iOS production-profile build

#### Sitting C — App Store Connect + first submission

- [ ] Create App Store Connect app record
- [ ] Beta app description drafted
- [ ] What-to-test instructions drafted
- [ ] Export compliance answered
- [ ] Privacy nutrition labels filled (declare no data collection by us; TestFlight's collection is Apple's, not ours)
- [ ] Internal testing group created
- [ ] First TestFlight submission via `eas submit --platform ios`

### Phase 4 — Device validation (real iPhone)

- [ ] Production-like build installed on physical iPhone
- [ ] Camera evidence flow
- [ ] Photo library evidence flow
- [ ] Voice memo evidence flow
- [ ] Local DB persistence across app restart
- [ ] Badge creation/export flow
- [ ] App icon + splash verified
- [ ] Force a deliberate test crash; confirm it appears in App Store Connect → TestFlight → Crashes

### Phase 5 — Privacy + legal (parallel with Phase 3, before submission)

**The 14-day clock for Phase 7 starts when you create the closed track in Play Console — not before. Phase 5 can complete independently of Phase 7.**

- [ ] Add platform-disclosure sentence to `docs/launch/privacy-policy.md`: "If you install via TestFlight or Google Play, those platforms collect crash reports under their own privacy policies."
- [ ] Add contact email to `docs/launch/privacy-policy.md`
- [ ] Host privacy policy publicly (`https://rollercoaster.dev/privacy` or similar)
- [ ] Permission copy reviewed (camera, photos, microphone)
- [ ] Encryption / export compliance reviewed (local crypto, secure storage, badge signing)

### Phase 6 — Quality dashboard refresh (parallel, before inviting testers)

**Deliverable:** know what you're actually shipping. Current grades are 2 months old.

- [ ] Run `/quality-score` to refresh `docs/quality/grades.md`
- [ ] Re-verify open items in `docs/quality/tech-debt.md` (5 HIGH-severity tests still listed; some may be resolved by recent PRs)
- [ ] Decide which HIGH-severity items block first invite vs. which are acceptable in beta

### Phase 7 — Android (after first iOS testers are running)

- [ ] Google Play Console personal account (~€25)
- [ ] Closed testing track created in Play Console — **the 14-day clock starts here**
- [ ] Recruit 12 testers (Google Group / email list, opt-in)
- [ ] Testers stay opted in for 14 consecutive days
- [ ] Android EAS profile + first build
- [ ] Apply for production access after 14 days

See `docs/launch/app-store-launch-plan.md` for the full Google Play context.

**Closed:**

- [#971](https://github.com/rollercoaster-dev/monorepo/issues/971) Sentry integration — incompatible with no-data-collected privacy promise
- [#972](https://github.com/rollercoaster-dev/monorepo/issues/972) In-app Report a Bug button — TestFlight + Play Console built-ins cover this
